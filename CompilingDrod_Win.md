# Building DROD

1. Install Python.
2. Download and build the libraries.
3. Update `include` and `library` paths in the project files.
4. Build the project.
5. Copy DLLs.
6. Copy `drod5_0.dat`.

### Building DROD RPG

To build DROD RPG, first complete steps 1 and 2 above, then use the project files within the `drodrpg` sub-directory to repeat an analogous process for steps 3 through 6.

#### Short version

There is a Python script that downloads and builds all of the required third-party libraries that DROD requires in `Scripts/InstallDependencies.win32.vs2013.py`.
It was optimized for Visual Studio 2013, and I've verified it also works for newer versions like MSVS 2019 with little effort required.
In order to build with this script do the following:

1. Have Python 3 installed.  You can get it from multiple sites, e.g., https://www.python.org/downloads/ .
1. Edit `Scripts/InstallDependencies.win32.vs2013.py` and provide the correct path to `DevEnv.com` in the overrideOptions() function.
2. Run the script, e.g., `py InstallDependencies.win32.vs2013.py` from the Scripts directory on the command line.
3. After it finishes (see below for known issues with building), open the solution `Master/Master.2019.sln` (etc) and build the project. The paths are all set to work with the landing locations of the LIBs and DLLs used in the dependency installing script.
4. After the script finishes building, copy DLLs from `Deps/Dll/Debug` or `Deps/Dll/Release` and paste them to `DROD/Debug/` or `DROD/Release/` respectively.
5. Go to your local installation of DROD (either Demo or Full version), copy `Data/drod5_0.dat` and paste it over the barebones version in `DROD/Data/`.
6. Run the game.

#### Download and build the libraries

The game requires the following libraries. Different versions may potentially be used but these are the ones present in the automatic dependency installation script:

 - `curl-7.27.0` => https://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.27.0.zip
 - `expat-2.1.0` => https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/expat/expat/2.1.0/expat-2.1.0.tar.gz
 - `fmodapi-375-win` => http://cdn.retrocade.net/fmodapi375win.zip (This file is no longer readily available from FMOD website)
 - `jpeg-6b` => http://cdn.retrocade.net/jpeg-6b.zip (This package contains libraries prebuilt in VS2013; original sources may be used and built manually)
 -  `json-0.6.2-rc2` => http://cdn.retrocade.net/jsoncpp-src-0.6.0-rc2.zip (This is exactly the same as the official version with the single exception being that assembly generation was removed from the release target in VS project)
 -  `libogg-1.3.0` => http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/ogg/libogg-1.3.0.tar.gz
 -  `libtheora-1.1.1` => http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.1.1.tar.gz
 -  `libvorbis-1.3.3` => http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/vorbis/libvorbis-1.3.5.tar.gz
 -  `lpng-1512` => https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/libpng/libpng15/older-releases/1.5.12/lpng1512.zip
 -  `metakit-2.4.9.7` => https://github.com/jnorthrup/metakit/archive/master.zip
 -  `sdl2-2.0.12` => https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.12.zip
 -  `sdl-ttf-2.0.14` => https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/release/SDL2_ttf-devel-2.0.14-VC.zip
 -  `zlib` => http://www.zlib.net/fossils/zlib-1.2.11.tar.gz

You need the DLLs from the following libraries to go into the same dir with your built drod.exe:
 - fmod
 - curl
 - expat
 - libfreetype (from sdl-ttf)
 - SDL2
 - SDL2_ttf
 - zlib (might best to use the one from lpng)

Known build issues:
 - Expat has an incompatible compiler flag when upgrading the project to MSVS 2019.  Workaround: I manually made the top change proposed on this StackOverflow topic:
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43141401/visual-studio-error-d8016-zi-and-gy-command-line-options-are-incompatible/43141537
   (If tweaks like this are required, to speed up repeat re-runs of the build script, note that you can set the `DepsToBuild` variable to skip re-building libraries that have already built successfully.)
   
   Open DepsSrc/expat-2.1.0/expat-2.1.0.expat.sln, and for each project file, right-click it --> Properties --> Configuration Properties --> C/C++ --> Code Generation --> Enable Function-level Linking. Change this to `Yes (/Gy)`

##### Update include and library paths in the project files

Once the above script completes successfully, LIB and DLL files are placed within a `Deps` sub-directory. With VS2019 at least, the include and link paths in DROD's project files may just work as-is to reference these directories and find the necessary third-party files. If so, there's nothing else you need to do for this step.

Otherwise, there are two ways to approach this - either copy the necessary include and library files from their original projects to a new location (like the build script does) and only have to add a single path to each projects.
Alternatively you can add all the necessary path to the projects or to your global settings ([more information here](https://www.curlybrace.com/words/2012/12/17/setting-global-c-include-paths-in-visual-studio-2012-and-2011-and-2010/)).

##### Build the project

Open one of the solutions located in `Master/` depending on which project files you've modified and build the project like you'd always do. It's highly likely the first time you'll encounter some errors - maybe you built a library incorrectly, maybe you have to update include/library paths, maybe you need to change some setting specific to your development environment.

##### Copy DLLs

Once the project is built copy the necessary DLL files to `DROD/Release` or `DROD/Debug` depending on which version was built.

#### Copy drod5_0.dat

Go to your installation of DROD (either Demo or Full version) and copy `Data/drod5_0.dat` and paste it to `DROD/Data/` over the barebones version included in the repo.

After all that, you should be able to run the game. If it works, then congratulations!

## Troubleshooting

Here is a list of all the problems that have been reported to happen while building the game and ways to work around them.

###### json_value.asm: No such file or directory

This may occur when building a release version of JSON library using the official sources - open the project in Visual Studio, go to `libjson` -> Properties -> C/C++ -> Output Files and set *Assembler Output* to *No Listing*.

##### Procedure entry point InterlockedCompareExchange@12 could not be located in the dynamic link library SDL2_ttf.dll

This is a runtime error caused by missing or incorrect version of `libfreetype-6.dll`. Make sure you have the DLL in your DROD directory and use the version taken from `SDL_ttf` library.
