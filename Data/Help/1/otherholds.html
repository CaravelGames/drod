These games can be installed and played stand-alone, or they can be downloaded into this game install with a
<a href="http://caravelgames.com/Articles/Games_2/CaravelNet.html">CaravelNet membership</a>.
There are also official expansion pack level sets, all playable in this version of DROD, called <b>Smitemaster's Selections</b>.
These Caravel-produced level collections add to the official story of DROD with quality writing and voice acting and are available
to order <a href="http://caravelgames.com/Articles/Games_2/SS.html">here</a>.
</p><p>
DROD also has an active online community who have made use of DROD's built-in <a href="editselect.html">Level Editor</a> to make their own level-sets 
(or "holds"). These are all available for free in the <a href="http://forum.caravelgames.com/holds.php">Holds</a> section of the website, and currently
number over 400 campaigns in all.
</p><p>
We've included 18 high quality holds with this game to get you started.
To play them choose "Change Location" from the "Play Game" menu, and click Import. These files are located in the "Homemade" folder under your installation's data directory.
</p><p>
These holds were made by some of the community's best hold architects,
including two by DROD's creator Erik Hermansen, who built <b>Smallsome Swicks</b> and <b>Down the Grimmish Hole</b>.
Among these you'll find easier beginner holds (<b>DROD tutorials</b>, <b>Easy or Hard</b>, <b>Dan's Dungeon</b>),
more advanced lessons in monster and element behaviour (<b>Advanced Concepts 1+2</b>),
ingenious and varied puzzle-based holds (such as <b>Phil's, Chaco's and Simon's Dungeons</b>),
tightly constructed and minimalistic puzzles (<b>Uncle Arable's Rooms</b> and <b>Simplicity</b>),
holds that use the DROD elements to implement completely un-DROD-like puzzles (<b>not dr0d2</b> and <b>Pelcho's Puzzles</b>) and more.
</p><p>
The <a href="http://forum.caravelgames.com/viewsitepage.php?id=275971">Beginner's Guide to DROD</a> discusses the different DROD versions in more detail 
and points out a few of the more beginner-friendly, interesting or innovative user-made holds to get you started.
</p><p>
Alternatively, you may want to try your hand at making some DROD levels yourself using the <a href="editselect.html">Level Editor</a>. Erik, DROD's creator,
gives some some hold-building tips and ideas <a href="lastword.html">here</a> and
