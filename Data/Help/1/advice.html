<h3><u>General Advice for Solving Rooms</u></h3>

<p>Things can get pretty hard in DROD, especially when you are just beginning as a new player of 
this unique game.  After a frustrating start, you might be tempted to call it quits, but we 
really don't want you to give up.  Beethro Budkin wouldn't give up!  He's very determined about 
getting to the bottom of things.  You can't let Beethro down--he needs your help!</p>

<p>Honestly, the game gets really good after you make that little investment upfront to learn how 
to play.  You may be irritated that the game doesn't play in a similar way to other puzzle games you 
are good at.  We didn't want DROD to be the same as those other puzzle games, so we built it 
with fresh gameplay mechanics.  Many of our fans were initially frustrated, 
but once they understood the game, came to love the game and play it for years.  So if the whole 
thing seems a little weird at first, please keep trying.  Some have declared DROD to be their 
favorite game; it could end up being your favorite, too!</p>

<p><a name="dying">Are</a> you dying a lot at times when you don't expect it?  Your character, Beethro, moves after 
you issue a command, and then all monsters move immediately after.  There is no delay between these 
two events so it can seem as though both happen simultaneously.  Understanding the movement 
sequence makes it much easier to predict and plan.  Try to slow down a little and observe what 
happens in response to your commands.  Remember that you can press the "backspace" key to undo a 
command.  If you get killed by a monster, you can even undo your death by pressing the "backspace" 
key before Beethro's death scream comes to an end.</p>

<p>Still stuck. There's more help at hand...</p>

<p><h3>If you need help... (in-game)</h3></p>

<p>You can read Gunthro Budkin's <a href="hints.html">hints and tips</a> handed down to future generations of Smitemasters, or familiarise yourself better 
with the <a href="monster.html">monsters</a> of DROD and how they <a href="movement.html">move</a>.</p>
<p>There are also number of useful features in-game. You can press F1 at any time to bring up this help documentation, 
which includes backstory, controls, explanations of how monsters and elements work and gameplay tips.
Right clicking on a tile will tell you the elements on that tile, and the movement order of the monster on it.
Left clicking on an orb or pressure plate will show you the door(s) it is associated with and whether it opens (green), 
toggles (amber) or closes (red) it/them. Left-clicking on a tunnel will show you where it connects to, on a bomb will 
show you the explosion radius, and a soldier will show you who or what he is targetting.
F6 will bring up the <a href="demos.html">demo screen</a>, where you can export your own solutions, import others' or download others' from 
<a href="caravelnet.html">Caravelnet</a>.</p>

<p><h3>If you need help... (in the real world)</h3></p>

<p>The <a href="http://forum.caravelgames.com">DROD online community</a> is generally very helpful and well-informed.
If you have a general question like "When's the next Smitemaster's Selection coming out?", "What's Gunthro's middle name?" or 
"How do Serpents move?", then the  <a href="http://forum.caravelgames.com/viewboard.php?BoardID=2">Caravel Forum General Board</a> is probably the 
best place to go. However, if you need to ask about a particular room in a particular hold, go to the 
<a href="http://forum.caravelgames.com/viewboard.php?BoardID=1">Hints 
and Solutions Board</a> and click on Get Help for a Room. You can then select the hold, level and room you're stuck on and you'll be taken to 
previous hints and solutions that have been given for that room (or if they're none, it'll open a new thread where you can ask for help).
You may also find the "<a href="http://forum.caravelgames.com/viewsitepage.php?id=275971">Beginner's Guide to DROD</a>" helpful.</p>
