<h3><u>Room Editor</u></h3>
<p>The Room Editor is reached by selecting a room in the <a
 href="editselect.html">Editor screen</a>. You can use it to edit
any room in the game's data file. </p>
<p>The Room Editor displays a view of the selected room roughly as it would be
seen in the game.</p>
<p><a name="selectobjects"><b>Selecting Objects for Placement</b></a> - A tabbed menu of game
objects is shown on the left side of the screen. The objects in
DROD are divided into four categories, also called <a name="layers">layers</a>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>room pieces: what the room is made from (such as walls, doors, pits, etc.)</li>
  <li>floor controls: force arrows and ortho-squares, checkpoints, tile lighting, and level entrance points</li>
  <li>items: what goes in a room, such as orbs, scrolls, potions, tar, etc.</li>
  and
  <li>monsters, allies and custom character scripts</li>
</ol>
<p>Select a tab to display that object
category. Click on an item in the menu to select it for placement.
Many menu items have two or more modes, which may be selected by rotating the tile
with the Q/W keys (default), the mouse wheel, or clicking on the menu item
again while already selected.
Items with several types have a pop-up menu that appears when the item is
clicked on again.</p>
<p><a name="placingobjects"><b>Placing Objects</b></a> - Left-click on a square in the room to place
the currently selected item there. Items cannot be placed on a
square if something already exists there on the same layer as the
object being placed. To delete placed objects, see "<a href="#deletingobjects">Deleting
Objects</a>" below. When an item can't or shouldn't be placed on a
square, it will be shaded red to indicate a new object
won't be placed there.</p>
<p><a name="setobjorientation"><b>Setting Object Orientation</b></a> -
The orientation of certain objects is significant (e.g., force
arrows, monsters, and the player's starting position). Use the rotation keys
or the mouse wheel to
rotate the way objects get placed. The "Roach" icon on the monster menu tab
is updated to indicate which way placed monsters will be oriented.
While holding down the left mouse button to place an object, its orientation
can be changed until the mouse button is released.
When certain customizable objects are selected,
using the rotation keys or mouse wheel will select the item's mode.</p>
<p><a name="placemultipleobj"><b>Placing Multiple Objects</b></a> - Dragging the mouse with the left
button down will fill the highlighted region with the selected object on
all open squares. Hint: <a href="#obstacles">Scenery objects</a> larger than 1x1 tile may be placed this way.
Some items, such as scrolls, are intended to be placed only one at a time.
For these items, placing more than one at a time is disabled.</p>
<p><a name="deletingobjects"><b>Deleting Objects</b></a> -
Right-clicking on a square will delete any object on that square from
the currently selected menu layer. Dragging a region with the
right mouse button down will delete all objects of that layer in the
selected area.  Exceptions are checkpoints and individual tile <a href="#lighting">lighting</a>.
These may be placed concurrently with other items on their menu tab,
so must be explicitly selected in order to delete them.  Hold &lt;Shift&gt; while
deleting to erase objects from all room layers in the selected region together.</p>
<p><a name="movingregions"><b>Moving large regions</b></a> - To make a duplicate copy of a room region,
drag the mouse to highlight a rectangular area and press &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; while
the mouse button is down to mark the region to be copied. The region marked
for copying stays chosen until a new region is marked or you begin
editing a different room. Press &lt;Ctrl-V&gt; at any time to
re-copy the marked region. Click on a
square to paste a copy of that region, the clicked square being the
top-left corner.  You may use this operation to paste a copied room region
into another room.</p>
<p><a name="reflectroom"><b>Reflecting the room</b></a> - Press &lt;F7&gt; to reflect the room
horizontally (about the vertical axis) and &lt;F8&gt; to reflect the room
vertically.  All object looks and behaviors are likewise updated to match.</p>
<p><a name="undoredo"><b>Undo/Redo</b></a> - Click the "Undo" button or &lt;Ctrl-Z&gt; to undo
changes you've made to the room during this session (since selecting the
room for editing). Press "Redo" or &lt;Ctrl-Y&gt; to
redo changes that have been undone. Note that undone commands cannot be
redone once you starting making other changes to the room.</p>
<p><a name="editsettings"><b>Editor Settings</b></a> - Enabling
the "Show Errors" checkbox will highlight objects in the room that
have an improper or questionable placement (see <a href="#roomerrors">Room Errors</a>
below). Uncheck "Save room automatically" on the <a
 href="settings.html">Player Settings Screen</a> if you want the editor
to prompt you before saving any changes you have made to a room.
When the room is saved, if the active player profile is not the author of the room's hold,
you will be prompted to make a copy of the hold that your player profile may edit
before any room changes are saved.</p>
<p><a name="playtesting"><b>Playtesting</b></a> - You can test the current room by hitting F5,
then clicking on the room position where you
want to begin play. During playtesting, you may hit the Undo key
(&lt;Backspace&gt; by default) to undo moves at any time.
Playtesting continues until &lt;Escape&gt; is pressed.</p>
<p><a name="chooseroom"><b>Choosing a Room from the Minimap</b></a> - Click on the level map to
select any room in the selected level. You can also click on an
empty area adjacent to an existing room to add a new room to the level at
that location. Hit &lt;Ctrl-X&gt; to cut and &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; to copy
the current room. Hit &lt;Ctrl-V&gt; to paste the marked room to the
currently selected spot on the map. Hit the &lt;delete&gt; key to
permanently erase a room from the game.</p>
<p><a name="switchlevel"><b>Switching to another level</b></a> - Press the PageDown and PageUp keys to
exit the current room you are working on and go to the next and previous <a href="#levelentrance">level
entrances</a>, respectively.</p>
<p><a name="customize"><b>Customizing and Special Objects</b></a> -
Several items can be customized to look or act a certain way. Customizable
objects are the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li><u><a href="character.html" name="characters">Characters</a></u>.  Special
      NPC <a href="script.html">scripts</a> can be defined to look or act a
      certain way.</li>
  <li><a name="orbs"><u>Orbs</u></a>. Click on an orb to view which room objects
      it affects. <a href="#yellowgates">Yellow gates</a>, force arrows and
      <a href="#lighting">lights</a> may be affected. Lightning bolts will flash
      from the orb to all objects it is defined to act on. Objects
      highlighted green will be opened/enabled when the orb is
      struck, objects highlighted orange will be toggled, and objects
      highlighted red will be closed/disabled. Clicking on an applicable object
      while in orb editing mode will change the effect the orb has on this
      object. Clicking on a tile without an orb or affected object will exit orb
      editing mode. Rotate or click on the orb menu selection again to change
      the orb type.</li>
  <li><a name="pressureplates"><u>Pressure plates</u></a>. As
      <a href="#orbs">orbs</a>, except they are activated when depressed. Also,
      they may be placed as a connected component larger than a single room
      tile. Rotate or click the pressure plate menu selection again to change
      the type of pressure plate.</li>
  <li><a name="yellowgates"><u>Yellow gates</u></a>. Click on a yellow gate to
      view which <a href="#orbs">orbs</a> and <a href="#pressureplates">pressure
      plates</a> affect it. Lightning bolts will flash from the gate to all
      objects acting on it. Clicking on an orb or pressure plate while in door
      editing mode will change the effect the object has on the selected gate.
      The color coding scheme is the same as for orb/plate customization.
      Clicking on a tile without an orb, pressure plate or yellow gate will exit
      door editing mode.</li>
  <li><a name="levelentrance"><u>Level entrances</u></a>. Each level can be
      entered at any number of user-definable locations. When placing a new entrance, specify what text the player will see when they
      enter the level at that point.  You may optionally add voiceover audio to play along with the text. Level entrance text may
      be disabled to avoid switching to the level entrance screen when coming to
      a level entrance. Also, you may select to have the level entrance screen for this entrance to be displayed only once during a campaign. Click on the entrance again to revise any of these parameters or to reorient the direction the player faces when entering the
      level here, or to mark this entrance as the main entrance
      to the level. The main level entrance designates its room as the level's
      Entrance room, or the relative origin from which all other rooms locations
      in the level are measured. Click and drag a level entrance with the mouse
      to reposition it elsewhere in the room without changing other parameters.</li>
  <li><a name="stairs"><u>Stairs</u></a>. After placing stairs, a dialog box
      will appear with the list of all <a href="#levelentrance">level
      entrances</a> with their text descriptions, along with any world maps. Select one of these
      to designate where the player goes from this staircase.
      Selecting "End hold" means the player will finish the hold on using these
      stairs. The destination level can be changed at any time by clicking on
      the staircase again. <u>Hint</u>: use pairs of stairways and adjacent level
      entrances to make two-way staircases.</li>
  <li><a name="serpents"><u>Serpents</u> and <u>gentryii</u></a>.
      Serpents are placed a piece at a
      time, starting from the head. Once you start placing a serpent, click on a
      room square to mark a turn in its body. Continue placing segments by
      clicking to lay down each new piece of the serpent. Pieces that have
      already been placed can be removed by clicking on part of the last segment
      placed. To finish placing the monster, click twice on the same spot. A
      serpent must be at least two squares long; gentryii do not have this restriction.
      Click on any previously placed serpent or gentryii to modify it.</li>
  <li><a name="halphslayer"><u>Halph/Slayer</u></a>.  These are special
      story-based characters, and placing only one of each at a time in the
      middle of the room is enforced. However, as many of these as desired may
      be placed along the room edge. The room edge will be highlighted,
      indicating that if the player enters the room on this tile, this character
      will follow the player into the room five turns later. If the edge tile is
      not vacant when entrance is attempted, it is attempted on subsequent turns
      that are multiples of five.</li>
  <li><a name="lighting"><u>Light sources</u></a>.  Click light sources after
      placement to change their color to the currently selected light color.  If
      their light color already matches the current color selection, clicking
      lights will increase their light intensity and radius by a tile, up to a
      maximum of eight tiles. Shift-click lights to decrease their intensity and
      range.</li>
  <li><a name="customtextures"><u>Custom room textures</u></a>. Multiple stock floor
      textures are included with each room style. Their difference is purely cosmetic. In addition, you may add your
      own custom image textures for floors, walls, and pits by selecting the respective tile on
      the object menu.  When first placing a custom texture tile in a room, you
      will be prompted to import an image file into your hold from disk. Custom texture images should typically be a multiple of the room tile
      size, which is 22x22 pixels. Textures will automatically repeat if you designate a room area larger than the image. <a name="supportedimg">Only</a> JPEG and PNG
      images are supported for import.  Transparency is supported for custom floor, wall and overhead textures. Once
      one or more images have been imported into your hold, you may select from
      these for display in any room in the hold. Only one image can be selected
      as a custom floor/wall/pit texture for each room. Press F9 to change the image selected
      for a room and its origin tile (i.e. the location the image starts tiling from). The origin tile can also be modified dynamically via predefined script vars during play.</li>
  <li><a name="overheadtexture"><u>Overhead textures</u></a>. You may select an alternate image in each room for use as an overhead texture. Judicious use of overhead textures can add a greater feeling of depth to a room. Tiles selected for overhead image display will be tinted blue in the room editor. Press Shift-F9 to select a different image and modify the origin of a room's overhead image. The origin tile can also be modified dynamically via predefined script vars during play.</li>
  <li><a name="obstacles"><u>Scenery obstacles</u></a>. Scenery obstacles can
      appear in a variety of different shapes and sizes. You can switch between
      different types of obstacles with the rotate keys or clicking the scenery
      menu option again while selected. If you place scenery obstacles by
      highlighting an area rather than square by square, then the largest
      possible obstacle of the current type will be placed. The following is a
      list of all possible object types and sizes:

      </table></li>
  <li><a name="tokens"><u>Tokens</u></a>.  Architectural tokens may be placed on
      the item layer to add persistent room effects when touched by the player
      or a double (with some exceptions, noted below). Rotate or click the token
      while selected on the object menu to select a different type of token for
      placement.
      <ul>
        <li><a name="arrowtoken"><u>Arrow rotator (CW/CCW)</u></a>.  Rotates all
            force arrows in the room one-eighth turn clockwise or
            counter-clockwise when stepped on. Stepping on it again rotates
            arrows back.</li>
        <li><a name="tartoken"><u>Tarstuff toggles</u></a>.  Swaps the nature of
            two kinds of tarstuff in the room, including monsters of that type.</li>
        <li><a name="visiontoken"><u>Enhanced vision</u></a>.  Allows the player
            to see what is under tarstuff, where evil eyes are looking, and all
            spiders in the room.</li>
        <li><a name="powertoken"><u>Power/target</u></a>.  Gives the player
            control of fegundos. Makes non-Beethro/Gunthro player roles into a monster
            target and allows using room items that normally only Beethro/Gunthro can
            use.</li>
        <li><a name="disarmtoken"><u>Disarm</u></a>.  Toggles whether the player
            can have a sword or not. Without a sword, the player does not drop
            trapdoors.  This token does not cancel other situations in which the
            player is already swordless.</li>
        <li><a name="movementtoken"><u>Persistent citizen movement</u></a>.
            Alters the behavior of citizens travelling along their supply
            station routes to never quit waiting for a route to the next station
            to open up while their path is blocked, instead of giving up and
            going to a different station after blocked for a certain number of
            turns. NOTE: This token functions automatically without the player
            needing to touch it.</li>
        <li><a name="conquertoken"><u>Conquer</u></a>.  When one or
            more of these is in the room, the player must touch one in process
            of conquering the room in order for the room to be conquered.
            For the purposes of CaravelNet conquer demo scoring, the turn the
            player touches one of these tokens counts as their room conquer time.
            So, reaching one of these faster than anyone else on the way to
            conquering the room will earn you a coveted "1st Place!"</li>
        <li><a name="weapon-token"><u>Weapon token</u></a>.  Allows the player
            to pick up a different weapon, which they will retain until leaving
            the room.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><a name="hold-complete-walls"><b>Hold complete walls</b></a> - A special
wall tile that becomes transparent and passable to the player once
the player has conquered the hold.</p>
<p><a name="masterwalls"><b>Master walls</b></a> - Another special type of wall tile
that becomes transparent and passable to the player once the player has mastered
the hold (i.e. exited the hold and conquered every <a href="editselect.html#secret">
secret room</a> in the hold at least once). Hint: use these to provide access to
bonus rooms that the player may only enter once they've mastered the hold.</p>
<p><a name="roomerrors"><b>Room Errors</b></a> - Errors highlighted in the room
include the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Matching room edges. Room edge squares are highlighted blue if they don't
      match the squares of an adjacent room. An open square will be highlighted
      if there is an obstacle (or no room) on the other side, for instance.</li>
  <li>Orbs. Orbs generally affect yellow gates, force arrows or lights.
      Orbs that don't affect any gates are marked orange.</li>
  <li>Gates. Yellow gates that don't have any orbs or pressure plates affecting
      them are marked orange. Red gates in a room without trapdoors are
      highlighted. Green gates in a room without any monsters are highlighted.
      Black gates in rooms without any tarstuff are highlighted.</li>
  <li>Stairs.  Stairs that exit the hold are highlighted, not as an error but as
      a helpful reminder.</li>
  <li>Strange placement. If an object is put in a location that might not allow
      it to be used correctly, it will be marked red. Examples of this are
      placing scrolls or potions on walls where the player can't get to them.</li>
</ol>
