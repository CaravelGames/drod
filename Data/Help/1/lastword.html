<h3><u>Ideas for Architects</u></h3>
<p>
So you're ready to be a dungeon architect, eh?  Well, the job is not so
glamorous as everyone makes it out to be.  It's hard work, I tell you! 
Especially building all the walls at right angles so they aren't crooked. 
And just try to get that damp, moldy smell out of your clothes after hanging
out underground all day!
</p><p>
Oh, but you're determined.  I can see there's no talking you out of it.  Fine,
but just remember that we dungeon architects are judged as a group.  If one
fellow throws together a shoddy hold, we all hang our heads in shame.  So you
newcomers gotta try a bit harder to avoid the common ugly mistakes.
</p><p>
So let's sit down and have a look at what's needed for the position...
</p><p>
<a name="motivation"><b>A Spirit of Generosity</b></a>
</p><p>
There are many different motivations for creating a hold.  You may enjoy sitting
behind the machinery and pulling the levers.  Or you could have profound ideas
for rooms that you yourself want to play and wonder how they will work.
Possibly, you want to understand how elements behave so you can play better.
Maybe you like to show off a bit and make people say, "Wow!  That guy must eat
brains for breakfast to get so impressively smart."
</p><p>
No motivation is right or wrong, (unless of course you are creating a hold to
enslave the masses to your every sadistic whim) but I believe that to produce
the most enjoyable puzzles, a spirit of generosity is essential.  Think of each
room you construct as a gift to your audience.  Imagine how nice it will be to
receive compliments for your work and know that you've provided a worthwhile
distraction.
</p><p>
Not to make it sound like you're saving the world, but maybe some guy in Detroit
has an enjoyable twenty minutes of his life while he sits at his work desk
munching on a bagel, playing your hold on his lunch break.  That's pretty cool,
isn't it? Picture all those little brain-racked Beethros bumping around in your
rooms, having a good time.  You built it, and they came!  When you think of how
players will react to your creation, you'll be motivated to make the corridors
longer, the passages twistier, the formations deadlier--whatever it takes to
pack your hold full of memorable entertainment!
</p><p>
<a name="aim"><b>Aim for Fun, not Difficulty</b></a>
</p><p>
A friend of mine proposed a General Law of Puzzles, or maybe it should just be
called a General Tendency of Puzzles.  The time required to create the puzzle is
just about always less than the time required to solve it.  We sat down for a
while and made up puzzles of all different types.  Riddles, logical problems,
word guessing, mathematical--one of us would create, and the other would solve.
I have to say I'm convinced that the rule holds true for just about any form of
puzzle.  Certainly in DROD, if your goal is simply to make a difficult room, it
is easy throw something together in five minutes that will take a player an hour
to slog through.  But it's likely that the resulting room will not be fun to
play--just hard to beat.
</p><p>
<a name="roomswstories"><b>Rooms with Stories</b></a>
</p><p>
See your puzzles not so much as challenges, but as a little story that will
unfold for the player.  Put yourself in the player's shoes--what will engage,
delight, and amuse him?  Confounding the player is just a byproduct of this
miniature drama.   Okay, I know you're thinking "What story?  This is a puzzle
game."  I mean stories at an abstract level.  Here are some examples:
</p><p>
<ul>
  <li>"Player walks into a room and sees an impossible array of enemies lined up
      against him.  There is no way he can hope to fight through them, but
      then...he sees hope.  If he can rush through a small gap in the monsters
      to get past them, he will find temporary safety in an alcove."</li>
  <li>"Layers of carefully positioned eyes must be peeled away before the player
      can gain access to an inner chamber.  At several points, the player
      wonders if there is any way left to him that will make progress, but close
      scrutiny reveals a weakness."</li>
  <li>"Player is confronted with a series of challenges, and whenever he makes
      an obvious choice, it turns out to be the wrong one.  Always, there is a
      more subtle solution to each problem.  After some false starts, the player
      begins to tread softly and consider his moves with care."</li>
  <li>"Player sees a lot of mimic potions in the room, which seems good at
      first, but then he notices there aren't very many places to put mimics.
      What should have been an easy room to solve is unexpectedly difficult."</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Stories like these are possible to express in DROD rooms.  To some extent, you
can create situations to provoke dramatic thoughts in the player's mind.
Admittedly, we aren't directing movies here, but inventing a simple plot for a
room can be the best beginning for the puzzles it will contain.
</p><p>
<a name="storystories"><b>Story Stories</b></a>
</p><p>
Of course, you can have regular stories with characters, setting, and all the
other elements of a novel.  From what I've heard, people really do appreciate a
little flavor added to their puzzles.  So despite your limited opportunities, I
recommend putting some work in the hold/level descriptions, scrolls, and NPCs
where appropriate.
</p><p>
If you want to keep your story set in the DROD universe, you could read about
Beethro and the Eighth on the
<a href="http://drod.caravelgames.com/">DROD.CaravelGames.com</a> website to get
context and inspiration.  There are no restrictions on how you can use existing
DROD characters.  So have fun, and be creative!
</p><p>
In future versions of DROD, expect even more ways to incorporate story elements
into your holds.  Also, if you would like to write something a little more
ambitious than what can be described in a hold, or perhaps a longer introduction
to your hold, you should really consider submitting your work for inclusion on
the <a href="http://drod.caravelgames.com/">DROD.CaravelGames.com</a> website.
</p><p>
<a name="trialanderror"><b>Avoid Trial-and-Error Puzzles</b></a>
</p><p>
There are exceptions to every rule, but the trial-and-error type of puzzle is
usually pretty annoying.  With these you are presented with a number of options
and given no clue as to which option is better.  So really, the only thing you
can do is methodically try each until you chance upon the correct one.  What's
even worse is when the penalty for the bad choice is <i>death</i>.  What's
worser than worse is when you have to start over from a long way back and repeat
all your moves.  What's worstest of all is when a room contains nothing more
than a series of trial-and-error situations.
</p><p>
There are three common ways to generate these boring trial-and-error problems:
</p><p>
<ol>
  <li><a name="orbs"><i>Orbs</i></a> - A player can click on an orb to see what
      doors it affects, but if there are several orbs in the room, it becomes
      difficult to remember what they all do.  You can ask the player to make
      guesses and remember things, but this quickly becomes tedious.
  </li>
  <li><i>Covering things with <a name="tar">tar</a></i> - It can be fun to
      discover walls and trapdoors under the tar, but again, let's not overdo
      it.  Hint: hold Shift while placing tarstuff to make sure it stays off the
      walls.</li>
  <li><a name="monstermovement"><i>Monster movement sequence</i></a> - The order
      that monsters move is not readily apparent, but it does affect what
      happens in the game.  Yes, you can be very tricky and set all sorts of
      specific movement sequences in the editor with puzzles requiring knowledge
      of the sequence to solve them.  But have mercy on the poor guy who will
      lose his eyesight staring at those tiny little roaches to figure out
      exactly how they will move.  It's particularly unfair when you set up a
      group of monsters, make some arbitrary movements, and then design a puzzle
      around the resulting monster formation.  You didn't have to predict the
      monster movements, but your players will.  (Or they might just give up and
      try somebody else's hold instead.  You don't want that, do you?)</li>
</ol>
</p><p>
When information is known to you, the author, but hidden from your players, you
should be a bit nicer to them.  Throw in some checkpoints.  Add a hint scroll or
use NPC scripting to have Beethro or someone else share a few hints.  Remove
some of your red herrings and clutter that would disguise the correct path.
</p><p>
<a name="quirks"><b>Avoid Exploiting Quirks</b></a>
</p><p>
The elements of DROD are meant to be simple and predictable by themselves.
Combine them together and things get complex.  But if you play around in the
editor, eventually you're going to find some weird, unpredictable behavior that
was overlooked by the development team or is just inherent to the "physics" of
DROD.  Something like: if a goblin moves diagonally into a square adjacent to a
roach queen on the turn preceding the spawn cycle, the roach queen will lay one
egg that hatches a turn earlier than the rest.  (This doesn't really
happen--it's just an example of something weird you might discover.)
</p><p>
You should pat yourself on the back for discovering such an oddity and maybe
post to the DROD forum about it, but don't make a puzzle that depends on this
bit of esoterica.  For two reasons:
</p><p>
<ol>
  <li>Players aren't likely to enjoy recreating your anomaly (What?  Are they
      supposed to be DROD scientists or something?)</li>
  <li>There's a chance that the development team will correct the behavior in
      the future, and then your puzzle will only work in an older version of
      DROD.  This has happened before.</li>
</ol>
</p><p>
<a name="unreachable"><b>No, not the Unreachable Rooms Again</b></a>
</p><p>
It's been a fun joke for me to play on you guys, but probably more fun for me
than for those who painstakingly searched through levels to find some way to
reach a room I intentionally made unreachable.  It looked like you could get to
the room, but nope, I guess not.  So that's kinda like gluing a quarter to the
ground--fun for the prankster, but a letdown for the fellow who tries for it.
Since I've already used this cheap trick a few times, it will look a bit old if
you use it too.
</p><p>
(I still feel guilty about this.  I even came up with a way to make up for the
trouble I put people through.  You'll see.)
</p><p>
<a name="lynchpin"><b>Lynchpin Puzzles</b></a>
</p><p>
By all means, try to create puzzles with lynchpins.  A lynchpin is some one
thing that must be discovered for a solution.  After the player has the
necessary insight, the rest is easy.  When the player gets it, he will feel like
he's just been converted to a new religion.  "Aha!" he says, and a second later,
"Why didn't I see that before?"  This feeling is more rewarding than slogging
through several obvious hurdles.  Most of us get that sort of tedium from our
jobs, so let us instead bask in the glory of one genius moment!
</p><p>
However, it's probably not wise to put too many lynchpins in one room.  Instead,
sprinkle them across several rooms: your puzzle domain will be larger, the
player will get more psychological breaks between challenges, and everyone will
praise you for your several genius ideas.
</p><p>
<b><a name="slashfests">Slashfests</a> (a.k.a. 'Carpal Tunnel Syndrome' here we come!)</b>
</p><p>
It can be fun to lay waste to a sprawling horde of monsters, even when there
isn't any real puzzle to solve.  I like to turn my brain off at times and just
hack away.  But the player can just use the slash macros by holding the Control
key while he slashes, making your room of roaches moot.  To make this sort of
room worth its bytes, require some tactical decisions from the player and inject
a little variety.  Can't your point be made with fifty roaches instead of five
hundred?
</p><p>
(By the way, I'm going back to one of my rooms now and taking out some roaches
so I don't look like a hypocrite.)
</p><p>
<a name="cosmetics"><b>Cosmetics Counts</b></a>
</p><p>
It's worth paying attention to how your rooms look--not just to how they play.
DROD gives you a detailed 38 x 32 space, which is typically more than is needed
to create puzzles.  That extra space is for visual style and to make the rooms
seem like a place instead of an abstract minimalist grid.  There's a whole Feng
Shui to it, and nobody can say definitively what makes a room look good or bad,
but here's some guidelines and ideas:
</p><p>
<ul>
  <li>Don't try to cram things and make every square count.  You got space,
      baby!  Use the whole room, or several rooms, to fit your puzzle.</li>
  <li>Design the layout of each whole level first so it looks good in the
      mini-map.  Then go back and add puzzles to the rooms.  In hindsight, I
      should have done a lot more of this with Dugan's Dungeon.</li>
  <li>If you have a pit or wall extending past the border of a room, let it
      continue for a distance in the adjacent room.  It's more convincing to see
      continuity between the rooms instead of abrupt changes, like where a pit
      suddenly becomes a wall in the next room.</li>
  <li>Just because you can place certain tiles in the editor doesn't mean you
      should.  If you mess around with the editor, you'll be able to create some
      effects that look decidedly broken.  For example, you could make all the
      walls of a level out of orbs.  Well, I guess that's not a crime, but now
      the player has to work harder to imagine he's inside of a dungeon, what
      with these ugly little balls all over the screen.  Have good reasons for
      strange visual effects.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
We now have some impressive graphical customization features in the DROD
level editor.  Not only can you choose from a large palette of floor styles and
visual elements, but you can also create your own floor, wall and pit art.
As a general rule,
only use at most two or three floor styles in any one room.  Any more than that
usually looks garish, distracting, and breaks the player's immersion in the game.
</p><p>
<a name="conclusion"><b>In Conclusion</b></a>
</p><p>
Well, that's all I have to say about it, and it's certainly enough.  As usual, I
feel a little embarrassed about going on so long.  Often people involved in
software engineering follow a policy of saying just enough for the situation,
and then moving briskly on to the next problem like a highly-disciplined martial
artist.  These people seem to get more respect, but I can live without it.  I'm
more like some kind of DROD preacher.  I want you to get an idea of the
possibilities, and then go forth and create!  If you end up doing some of the
things that I said were bad, it really doesn't matter that much to me, and I'm
pretty sure the Dungeon Architects Association won't blacklist you.  Truthfully,
I'll just be happy if you decide to invest a little of your creative energy in
this game that me and some other guys wrote.
