<h3><u>Player Selection Screen</u></h3>
Choose "<b>C</b>hange Player" on the <a href="commands.html">Main Menu</a> to access
the Player Selection Screen. This screen has the following options available:
<br />
<p><a name="select"><b><u>O</u>kay</b></a> - selects the highlighted player profile. Each player profile
contains user preference settings and its own game progress.</p>
<p><a name="new"><b><u>N</u>ew Player</b></a> - creates a new player profile. This option is useful
when you have more than one person playing DROD on this installation.</p>
<p><a name="delete"><b>Delete player</b></a> - permanently deletes the selected player profile. This
includes deleting the player's saved games and demos (so make sure this is
really what you want to do!).</p>
<p><a name="export"><b><u>E</u>xport</b></a> - saves the active player profile to disk with all
recorded demos and saved games. This option facilitates transferring your player
settings and game information to a different DROD installation.</p>
<p><a name="exportsaves"><b>Export <u>S</u>aves Only</b></a> - places all the current player profile's saved
games in a file on disk with your player-specific information excluded.
These saved games may then be imported by any player.  Hint: use this
option to share your progress with other DROD players without giving
them author access to your levels.</p>
<p><a name="import"><b><u>I</u>mport</b></a> - loads a DROD player profile exported to disk either with
"Export" or "Export Saves only".  This allows you to recover
exported player saved games.  Hint: to import saved games for a specific hold
(set of levels), first import the hold into your
installation of DROD, then import the player data.</p>
<p><b><u>C</u>ancel</b> - returns to the previous screen.</p>
