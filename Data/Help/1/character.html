<h3><u>Character Scripting</u></h3>
<p><a name="npc">Non-player characters (NPCs)</a> can be used to develop a story
in your hold by assigning them a list of things to do and say.
When an NPC is placed in a room, a dialog box will appear for
customizing the NPC's appearance and behavior.  On this dialog, a list box
displays the character's script, which is initially empty.
The script tells the NPC what to do when the player enters the room.</p>

<p><a name="graphic"><b>Graphic</b></a> - Select what your NPC will look like from the list of
available actors.  Selecting "None" (the default)
indicates this NPC is used for scripting events but will not appear as a visible character
in the room.  Hint: With the "None" setting, a character cannot be made visible.</p>

<p><a name="management"><b>Character Management</b></a> -
Click <b>"Characters"</b> to pop up the Character Management dialog.
Here, you may create custom actors for use anywhere in the hold being edited.
Type a name and click "Add Character" to create a new actor for this hold.
Next, select what the actor will look like from the Graphic list box.
Click <b><a name="defaultscript">"Default script"</a></b>
to define what an instance of this character type will do by default
if no script commands are defined for the particular NPC instance.
Also, use this in conjunction with <b><a href="script.html#startglobalscript">Start Global Script</a></b>
to create a script that runs in each room instead of just one particular room.
Click <b>"Custom avatar"</b> to import a custom face from an image file (130x164 pixels)
on disk into your hold.
When this actor speaks, this image will be shown in the game screen's face box.
The custom face may be extended to the right to provide protraits for speaking moods, with each additional portrait being 130 pixels wide.
The supported moods, in the order they should appear in the image are <b>Normal</b>, <b>Aggressive</b>, <b>Nervous</b>, <b>Striking</b>, <b>Happy</b>, <b>Dying</b>, and <b>Talking</b>.
Click <a name="customtiles">"Custom Tiles"</a> to import a custom tileset for this
character.<br />
<br />
Tilesets typically range from a 1x1 tile image to a 9x6 grid of 22x22 pixel tiles.
Each column stores tiles for a certain orientation, starting from northward and
progressing clockwise at 45 degree increments.
The ninth column stores the central <a name="orientation">orientation</a> (i.e. no direction).  If an
orientation to display is not included, the northward image is used by default.
The <u>second</u> row may be included to display a second animation frame, displayed
at random time intervals.
The <u>third</u> row, if included, stores custom sword images for character types
wielding swords.
The <u>fourth</u> row, when included, stores custom images for a sword-wielding
character when they are not currently wielding a sword.
The <u>fifth</u> and <u>sixth</u> rows are for displaying wading in shallow water,
with and without wielding a weapon, respectively.
If the third and subsequent rows are not included, then tiles from the first
row are displayed in their place.  If the type set is an entity without a sword,
the third, fourth and sixth rows are ignored.<br />
<br />
Alternately, when a custom tile image is set, you may enter a looping <a name="animationspeed"><b>Animation Speed</b></a>. When a non-zero value is specified, then the rows in the custom tile image take on a different meaning. Now, the display frame will advance through the rows at the rate you specify. The animation will loop following the final row/frame.
<br />
Click "Default" to <a name="reset">reset</a> the actor's avatar or tileset to the default for this
character type.
<br />
Click <a name="delete">"Delete"</a> to permanently remove the selected actor from your hold.</p>
<p><a name="visible"><b>Visible</b></a> - If checked, the NPC will be visible when the player
enters the room.  Otherwise, it will be invisible.  When an NPC is invisible, its
script continues to play but it otherwise behaves as if it were not in the room.
Hint: making a character with a "None" graphic visible will set it to the
"Citizen" type.</p>

<p><a name="options"><b>Options</b></a> - Click to set the NPC's processing sequence, or the relative order in which the NPC takes its turn in relation to other entities in the room.</p>
<p><a name="addcommand"><b>Add Command</b></a> - Click to add another <a href="script.html">command</a>
to the script.</p>
<p><a name="deletecommand"><b>Delete Command</b></a> - Deletes the selected commands from the script.  Also
performed by pressing the &lt;Delete&gt; key.</p>

<p><a name="reorder"><b>Reordering commands</b></a> - During play, commands are performed in the order
they are placed in the script.  Hold down the mouse button on a command and drag it
to reposition it in the script.</p>

<p><a name="cutcopypaste"><b>Cut-copy-paste commands</b></a> - With one or more commands selected, press
&lt;Ctrl-X&gt; to cut the commands from the script and place them in the script
clipboard.  Press &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; to make a copy of the selected script commands
and place them in the script clipboard.  Press &lt;Ctrl-V&gt; to paste the
script commands in the script clipboard after the selected script command.
The script clipboard is only valid while editing the current NPC.</p>
<p><a name="importexport"><b>Importing and exporting commands</b></a> -
Script commands may be imported from and exported to the operating system clipboard.
Press &lt;Ctrl-B&gt; to export the currently highlighted script commands.
Then you may paste these commands as text into a text editor.
Press &lt;Ctrl-Shift-B&gt; to import a text selection from the OS clipboard.
Command syntax must match that of exported commands in order for text to be
imported correctly.</p>

<p>Click "Okay" to finish customizing the NPC.</p>
<p><a name="revise">You</a> may click on the character in the room at any time
to revise its appearance or script.  With the character monster selected in
the edit menu, click on the NPC again to change its initial orientation.
<a name="reposition">Click</a> and drag a character to reposition it in the room.</p>
