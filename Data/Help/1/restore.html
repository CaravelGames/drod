<h3><u>Restoring Saved Games</u></h3>
<p>The Restore Screen is reached by choosing "<b>R</b>estore" from the
<a href="commands.html">Main Menu</a>.&nbsp; You can restore to any one of
several previous save points in the game.&nbsp; Each save point stores
information about the current room and play history, such as which rooms have
been explored and conquered up to this point. &nbsp;<a name="save">Saving</a> is performed
automatically as you explore the world of DROD, hence there is no save command.</p>

<p>The Restore Screen has the following options available:</p>

<p><a name="level"><b>Choose Level</b></a> - Players can choose to restore to any of the levels
they have visited.&nbsp; Choose one from the level list to select it, or restart
from the very beginning of the game by clicking the &quot;Hold Start&quot; button.</p>

<p><a name="room"><b>Choose Room</b></a> - Click on the level map to select any room that's been
visited previously.&nbsp; Your journey is saved in each room at the point when
the room was last entered before being conquered.&nbsp; Rooms grayed out on the
map are rooms that had not yet been visited when the currently selected room
was last saved.&nbsp; Click the &quot;Level Start&quot; button
to start from the point when the level was first entered.</p>

<p><a name="position"><b>Choose Position</b></a> - The mini-room shows the point from which the room
will be restored. &nbsp;Room checkpoints that were touched by the player are
represented by &quot;X&quot; buttons.&nbsp; Click on an &quot;X&quot; to restore
from the last time this checkpoint was stepped on.&nbsp; By default, the room
will be restored at the latest checkpoint used.&nbsp; Click the &quot;Room Start&quot;
button to return to the time in your quest when the player last entered the room
before conquering it.</p>

<p><a name="secrets"><b>Save point statistics</b></a> -
The properties for the currently selected save point are shown in the bottom-left corner of the screen.<br />
<b>Explored</b> indicates how many rooms you have ever explored in the selected level.<br />
<b>Secrets found</b> indicates the total secret rooms that have been conquered for this level across all saved games.
This number can be used to check how many secret rooms you still need to complete before mastering the hold.
You don't need to complete the secret rooms in the same savefile.<br />
<b>Total rooms conquered/explored</b> indicates the total rooms conquered/explored in this hold for the currently selected save point.
This is useful to make sure you have selected the latest save point while playing through a hold.<br />
<br />
When a hold is completed, the <i>Explored</i> stat on the Restore Screen will change into a percentage of the rooms explored in that level,
and <i>Secrets completed</i> will also indicate how many secret rooms exist for you to find in the selected level.
</p>

<p><a name="restoring">Click</a> the &quot;Restore&quot; button to continue from the selected save point.&nbsp;
Note that restoring to a previous save point will return you back to that point
in time in the level, with rooms that were explored or conquered after that
point being reset to the way they were then.</p>

<p><a name="viewing-challenges">Click</a> the &quot;Challenges&quot; button to view a list of all scripted challenges you have completed in the current hold.</p>

<p><a name="export-saves">Click</a> the &quot;Export saves&quot; button to export all your saved game data for the current hold. You can use this to share progress for that hold, without sharing author access to your levels.</p>

<p><a name="demos"><b>Viewing demos</b></a> - Press F6 to view <a href="demos.html">demos</a> recorded in the highlighted room.</p>
