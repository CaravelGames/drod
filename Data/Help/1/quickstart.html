<h3><u>Quick Start &amp; Keyboard Commands</u></h3>
<p>DROD is a turn-based game of puzzles and exploration.  Guide Beethro, a
professional dungeon exterminator, in clearing rooms of monsters and solving puzzles.</p>
<p>Here are some instructions for people who don't like to read
instructions. &nbsp;To advance in DROD, you:
</p>
<p>1. Destroy all of the monsters in all of the rooms.
<br />
2. Find the staircase that exits the level.
</p>
<p>DROD is turn-based. Monsters move only after you move. &nbsp;Have patience--this game is
played quite differently from others and takes some getting used to.

<p>These keyboard commands can be changed from the <a href="settings.html">Settings Screen</a>.
For more information and other game commands, see <a href="keyboard.html">Keyboard Commands</a>.
</p>
<p>Hints: You can wait as long as you want before making each move. &nbsp;The monsters
in the room will move immediately after you move. &nbsp;For effective
maneuvering, remember that monsters do not move simultaneously with your
movements but right afterward instead, so you may step onto a
vulnerable square as long as you destroy the threatening monster with
that movement.</p>
