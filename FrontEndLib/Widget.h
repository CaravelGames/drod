//SUMMARY
//
//CWidget is an abstract base class from which all widgets derive.  A widget is
//a graphical area which paints by certain rules and can optionally handle events.
//Widgets may contain other widgets, and many operations take advantage of this
//hierarchical grouping.  For example, moving one widget will move all of its
//children at the same time.
//
//Several drawing utility functions are implemented in CWidget.  It is convenient
//to put them here because nearly all drawing in this app must be done in the
//context of a widget.
//
//USAGE
//
//You can derive new classes from CWidget.  Typically, you would want widgets to
//appear on a screen, and this can be accomplished by constructing a new
//CWidget-derived class and calling the AddWidget() method of the CScreen-derived
//class.  You can add a widget to any other widget, not just a CScreen-derived class.
//Painting, loading, unloading, moving, hiding, and disabling of a parent widget
//will affect all of its children.
//
//The sections that follow describe implementing a new CWidget-derived class.
//
//FOCUSABLE WIDGETS
//
//If you want your widget to be capable of receiving the focus, you should derive
//it from CFocusWidget instead of CWidget.  When a widget is derived from CFocusWidget,
//its IsFocusable() method will return true instead of false.
//
//After focusable widgets have been added to a parent, they may be explicitly removed
//and added from the focus list with calls to CEventHandlerWidget::AddFocusWidget()
//and RemoveFocusWidget().
//
//ANIMATED WIDGETS
//
//If you want your widget to be automatically animated between events, then you
//should override CWidget::IsAnimated() to return true and CWidget::HandleAnimate()
//to perform the animation.
//
//If you call AddWidget() to add a widget to a parent without an event-handler,
//the widget will not be automatically animated.  For example, adding a CScalerWidget
//to a CFrameWidget before the CFrameWidget is added to a CScreen, will result in the
//CScalerWidget not being animated.  However, if the CScalerWidget was added to the
//CFrameWidget AFTER CFrameWidget was added to the CScreen, the CScalerWidget
//would animate.
//
//After animated widgets have been added to a parent, they may be explicitly removed
//and added from the animation list with calls to CEventHandlerWidget::AddAnimatedWidget()
//and RemoveAnimatedWidget().
//
//PAINTING
//
//You must implement the pure Paint() method in your CWidget-derived class.  When
//you want to draw something, call GetDestSurface() for the surface.  It goes against
//the widget design to draw directly to the screen, which may or may not be the
//destination surface (See CWidget::SetDestSurface()).
//
//If you need to directly write to the pixel data, enclose your writes in a
//LockDestSurface()/UnlockDestSurface() pair.  Also, you must choose whether to make
//your routine safe for clipping or not.  Clipping is supported in CWidget methods,
//but in no derived classes, that write directly to the pixel data,
//except by accident (debug errors).  You can override CWidget::PaintClipped() and
//put an "ASSERT(!"Can't paint clipped.")" statement in it.
//This will designate your widget as unsafe for clipping and keep it out of trouble.
//If you are not directly writing to the pixel data, your widget is safe for clipping.
//
//NOTE: If a child widget is to be clipped to a specified parent region, then
//child widgets should never call, or have their Paint() method called directly.
//Instead, call RequestPaint().  This will ensure that clipping is performed.
//
//The last two lines of your CWidget::Paint() should probably be:
//
//  PaintChildren();
//  if (bUpdateRect) UpdateRect();
//
//The first line is not strictly necessary if your widget is not meant to contain other
//widgets, but adding the call adds just a tiny bit of overhead.  It makes your
//widget paint any contained widgets.
//
//The second is used by the painting machinery to handle all surface updates, and needs
//to be present.
//
//LOADING AND UNLOADING
//
//You only need to override Load() if your widget requires resource loading or has some
//failable initialization.  If you override Load(), follow this sequence:
//
//  Perform loading tasks for your widget.
//  If any failures occurred then return false.
//  "return LoadChildren();"
//
//If you override Load(), you should also override Unload() to provide a symmetrical
//unloading.  It should follow this sequence:
//
//  "UnloadChildren();"
//  Perform unloading tasks for your widget.
//
//Note that a widget may be constructed, and then loaded and unloaded MULTIPLE times
//before it is destructed.  This is under the control of the screen manager, which
//will leave some screens (and their children) in memory, and unload others to reduce
//memory consumption.  You want to retain state information after an Unload(), but not
//resources.  For example, CTextBoxWidget will release the bitmap is uses to draw
//itself in Unload(), but will not release its text data until the destructor is called.
//
//HANDLING EVENTS
//
//If your widget is a child of an event-handling widget (CScreen and CDialog-derived
//classes), it will receive events from an active event-handling widget.  The
//CWidget::Handle*() methods will be called with information about the event.  You
//override the Handle*() methods that your widget should respond to.  See descriptions
//of the handlers below.
//
//Handlers are responsible for repainting the widget when it changes.  If your
//handler is going to call an event notifier, such as OnSelectChange(), paint your
//widget first.  This generally makes your widget appear to respond more quickly
//to user interaction.
//
//ACCEPTING TEXT ENTRY
//
//If your widget is meant to record a text entry in response to keypresses, then
//you should override CWidget::AcceptsTextEntry() to return true.  If your widget
//merely responds to keypresses, but doesn't convert them to text directly, then
//you shouldn't override AcceptsTextEntry().
