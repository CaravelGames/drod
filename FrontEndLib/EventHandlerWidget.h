//SUMMARY
//
//A class derived from CEventHandlerWidget is responsible for handling events, sending
//event notifications to derived classes, and providing control methods for selecting
//focusable widgets.
//
//USAGE
//
//Derive your new widget class from CEventHandlerWidget or the two classes which
//are derived from CEventHandlerWidget--CDialogWidget and CScreenWidget.  Default UI 
//behaviour will be given to your class.  Overide the event notifier methods for
//events you are interested in.  For example, if you want to play a song when the user
//presses the "Play Song" button, override OnClick() in your derived class.
//
//Event notifiers that apply to a specific widget will receive a dwTagNo parameter
//indicating to which widget the event applied.  Event notifiers corresponding directly 
//to an SDL event will receive SDL event information in a parameter.  See descriptions 
//of event notifiers below to determine what criteria must be true before they are called.
//
//Event polling and notification begin when Activate() is called, and end when
//Deactivate() is called.  If you are deriving from CScreen, you should leave 
//these calls to the CScreenManager loop, and just use GoToScreen() to specify the
//next destination screen.  If you are deriving from CDialog, you should use the
//all-in-one CDialog::Display() method, which handles activation and deactivation.
//
//You can explicitly change the focus by using one of the widget selection methods.  
//Default focus-changing behaviour is provided without this.
//
//ADDING NEW EVENT NOTIFIERS
//
//It should be pretty straightforward if you look at the other notifiers and follow their
//example.  One design consideration is that you can call an event notifier from 
//widget event-handling code, as opposed to calling from this class.  For example, 
//OnSelectChange() is called by CListBoxWidget when it learns that its selection has 
//changed.  The information needed to determine CListBoxWidget's selection change is
//not available from CEventHandlerWidget, so the solution is to call the notifier
//from CListBoxWidget.
//
//GETTING NEW WIDGETS HOOKED IN
//
//If your widget doesn't respond to input, then there is nothing extra to do.  It will
//not be affected by events.
//
//Derive your new widget from CFocusWidget if it should be selectable.  Your painting
//code should call CFocusWidget::IsSelected() and paint for the two different states.
//
//If your widget responds to input, look at the CWidget::Handle*() methods.  
//You should write your widget to respond to the existing Handle*() methods that are
//already called from CEventHandlerWidget, and not add widget-type-specific code 
//into CEventHandlerWidget.  If the existing Handle*() methods do not provide the 
//appropriate stimuli for your widget to take correct behaviour, try to make 
//modifications that are not special-cased to your widget's event-handling, but 
//general to all widgets.
//
//The Handle*() methods are described in Widget.h.
