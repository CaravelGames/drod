//SUMMARY
//
//CEffect is an abstract base class for graphical effects drawn on top of widgets.
//Effects are temporary animations drawn by the owner widget.  The screen surface 
//update is performed by the owner widget.
//
//USAGE
//
//The widget must have code to add, draw, and clear effects before an effect 
//can be used with it.  In CRoomWidget, a call to AddTLayerEffect() or 
//AddLastLayerEffect() is all that is needed for room widget to handle the effect.
//
//DESIGNING AN EFFECT
//
//1. Create a new class derived from CEffect.  
//2. Your constructor should take params for everything needed to draw the effect 
//   over its lifetime.  For speed, try to perform calculations here instead
//   of in Draw().  In other words, it is better to perform a calc one time in
//   the constructor, instead of every time Draw() is called from the i/o loop.
//   Avoid keeping pointers passed from cue event private data or current game--
//   they can become invalid during the lifetime of your effect.
//3. Override the Draw() pure virtual method in your class.  Draw() should do
//   the following:
//    a. Return false without drawing if the timespan that the effect can 
//       be drawn in has past.  For example if you have an explosion that lasts
//       1000ms and TimeElapsed() returns 1002, then the effect is no longer
//       active and you should return false.
//    b. Decide what to draw based on the time elapsed since construction
//       returned from TimeElapsed(), the class members set by the constructor,
//       and data from the owner widget.
//    c. Draw to the screen surface.
//    d. Specify the bounding box the effect covers (in absolute coordinates).
//    e. Return true to specify the effect is still continuing.
//       (If the effect has completed, return false before drawing anything.)
