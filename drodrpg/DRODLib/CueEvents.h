//CCueEvents class declaration, cue event IDs, and classification macros.

//GENERAL
//
//Cue events are messages returned to the caller of CCurrentGame::ProcessCommand().
//Typically, these messages would correspond to game events that need a sound
//or graphical effect that the caller should handle.  The ProcessCommand caller is
//not required to handle any of the cue events.  Since CCurrentGame does nothing
//UI-related it is possible to run games "silently" without any UI.
//
//Each cue event may have one or more private data pointers (void *pvPrivateData)
//associated with it.  Some cue events will use this to point to data associated with
//the cue event.  You will know by the cue event ID which class or data type is
//pointed to, and can cast to that associated type for access to the private data.
//The private data pointer should not be deleted.
//
//USAGE
//
//Call Add() to say that an event occurred and optionally associate private data that
//may be used later to react to that event.  For example when a monster is killed,
//a CMonster pointer is associated with the CID_MonsterDiedFromStab event.  If three
//monsters were killed on a turn, then three CMonster pointers will be available for
//retrieval.
//
//To simply check whether events occurred, use HasOccurred() or HasAnyOccurred().  The
//IDCOUNT() macro defined in IDList.h should be used for calls to HasAnyOccurred().
//
//To retrieve private data, call GetFirstPrivateData(), and follow up with calls to
//GetNextPrivateData() if appropriate.  GetFirstPrivateData() will cause
//GetNextPrivateData() to return the second private data associated with the specified
//cue event if available.  GetFirstPrivateData() should also be used in lieu of
//HasOccurred() to check for a cue event when private data may be retrieved.  If you
//just want to check an ID without retrieving private data, then call HasOccurred() or
//HasAnyOccurred().
//
//Never delete private data pointers retrieved from cue events.  Deletion will be
//handled in the CueEvents destructor or in CCurrentGame depending on the design
//of the cue event.
//
//DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR CREATING NEW CUE EVENTS
//
//Cue events are mainly for description of UI-related events, but there are other
//tasks where they can be put to good use, for example:
//
//When a monster gets killed by sword stab, CMonster::OnStabbed() passes back a
//CID_MonsterDiedFromStab cue event, and CCurrentGame::ProcessPlayer() handles
//the cue event with a call that deletes the CMonster instance which had its
//OnStabbed() member called.  It would be possible to execute "delete this" within
//OnStabbed(), but to avoid problems with bad pointers, the deletion is handled
//outside of CMonster code using the cue event.
//
//The tar mother is another example.  She causes tar in a room to grow every 30 turns.
//If there are multiple tar mothers in the room, the tar should grow just once--not for
//each tar mother processed.  By checking for a CID_TarGrew cue event after all of the
//tar mothers have been processed, we can make the tar grow just once if there are any
//tar mothers in the room and 30 turns have passed.  If the tar growing was performed
//up in CTarMother::Process() there would need to be some kind of state-checking
//between the tar mothers to ensure the tar grew one time only.
//
//There may be other valid uses of cue events.  Here are some other guidelines for
//making cue events.
//
//1. Avoid creating cue events that don't correspond to actions which the
//ProcessCommand() caller will handle.  The two cases described above are
//valid exceptions.  Typically, you can handle a purely game-logic event in the code
//that determines the event should occur.  For example, in ProcessPlayer() you
//can detect that the swordsman has destroyed the last trapdoor and make a call to
//RemoveRedDoors() from that routine.  This is preferable to passing a
//CID_RemoveRedDoors (fictitious) cue event back to ProcessCommand() or to its
//caller for handling the removal of red doors.  A local handling of an event is
//usually clearer to other developers and requires less time to process during
//execution.
//
//2. Wait for a UI feature to be planned before adding a cue event that may or may
//not be handled by the ProcessCommand() caller in the future.  It's easy to add
//cue events later, and we don't want to have the clutter and inefficiency of unused
//cue events.
//
//PRIVATE DATA VALIDITY GUARANTEE
//
//Private data pointers returned by ProcessCommand() are guaranteed to be valid
//until the CCurrentGame instance that originally returned them goes out
//of scope or the ProcessCommand() method is called again on the same instance.
//
//Conversely, when creating new cue events that have private data, you should design
//so that the above guarantee is honored.  If your private data object is only used
//to send data to the ProcessCommand caller, then probably you should set the
//bIsAttached parameter to true in your call to CCueEvents::Add().  Otherwise, the
//bIsAttached parameter should be false, and you must make sure that the pointer
//will be good at least until the next call to ProcessCommand().  This should usually
//be accomplished by using a member variable of CCurrentGame to hold the data to
//which you will return a pointer.
