<h3><u>Mod management screen</u></h3>
<p>This screen shows a list of game media that are installed.
The list defaults to the set of pre-defined room styles.</p>

<p><b>Export</b>: You may make your own style mods (documented elsewhere).
When your graphical mod is ready, click Export to package your image files
into a .DRMF (DROD Media File) on disk.  You may opt to publish your DRMFs on
CaravelNet for other DROD players to download and use in this game.</p>

<p><b>Import</b>: Select a .DRMF to install a mod file you have on disk to
your DROD installation.
(Doing this will insert an entry for the mod in your drod.ini file.)</p>

<p><b>Download</b>: With a CaravelNet subscription, you may download and import
graphical mods published on CaravelNet.</p>

<p><b>Filter</b>: By default, all visible mods are listed.
You may select to view only CaravelNet or local mods.</p>
<p><b>Delete</b>: Select a mod that you have imported previously and click Delete
to remove it from your installation.</p>
