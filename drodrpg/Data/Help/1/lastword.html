<h3><u>Ideas for Architects</u></h3>
<p>
Looking to have a go at using the editor to make your own level set?
Since the release of DROD RPG: Tendry's Tale almost two decades ago, the
DROD RPG community has figured out what works and what doesn't.
When it comes to creative works, rules were made to be broken and nothing
is wrong, but some things can really help smooth out the gameplay and
help the creative juices flow. Here are some guidelines I've figured out
over the years.
</p><p>
<a name="strongtheme"><b>A Strong Theme Makes the Ideas Flow</b></a>
</p><p>
Staring at the editor screen and not sure what to do? Ideas can flow more naturally
if they have some thematic trend to adhere to. Limitations breed creativity!
It can help to start a level by first deciding on some overall trend, this can be purely
visual or gameplay oriented, or both.
</p><p>
I usually start by deciding on a sense of place that provides a visual identity.
For example, it might be a cave with jagged walls, or an Empire location.
Perhaps it takes place surrounding a great lake. This can lead you to developing large
"macro structures" that cross room boundaries, like a large chasm or a river.
</p><p>
This visual identity can help you settle on some fun mechanical ideas.
Maybe your lake idea leads you to deciding it would be fun to put flippers in a
heavily guarded location, then you can design the level around before and after flippers.
Perhaps the Empire location is filled with crates. The caves have an oremite outbreak.
</p><p>
You really want to do all you can to avoid an endless network of stringy one-tile corridors
in a flatly-lit, endless sea of concrete which would be indistinguishable from a first attempt
to make a randomly-generated alogrithm to build levels. DROD RPG offers a lot of visual tools
to make your ideas more fun.
</p><p>
<a name="goodvibes"><b>Good Vibes are Good Times</b></a>
</p><p>
You can have whatever reason you want to make your own DROD RPG level set, but you probably want others
to enjoy playing it too. It's fine to make a very exact, very hard level set that kills you easily,
but this won't prove to be very popular. People don't like feeling like the level set is out to
trick them and beat them up, they just want to make decisions and have fun along the way.
</p><p>
When I make level sets, the approach that I take is to focus on making decisions feel interesting,
and try to avoid "knowing" the answer. When optimising, eventually everything will boil down to the
one "true and correct" path, but you will want people to still have fun along the journey to figuring
that out. So it's important to me that there is still plenty of leeway for less optimal decisions.
It's a matter of trying to make people feel like their choices were good, even if they turn out to be
less than optimal.
</p><p>
My main goal is to avoid having decisions that feel immediately obvious, or make the player feel stupid
shortly after taking it. If a decision looks like one option is too obviously bad, or too obviously good,
then there is no reason to think about it and you might as well not include it.
</p><p>
You have plenty of ways to buff bad decisions and worsen good ones, with extra health potions, stronger
monsters, different coloured keys, and so on. Shovels and dirt blocks allow for a more fine-tuned balancing.
</p><p>
But it's important to keep in mind that not every decision wants to be perfectly "numerically balanced".
It's OK to have resource trades in hard to reach areas be better value. Reward the player for pushing ahead.
Different areas can be balanced differently, for example one level is more demanding on green keys than another.
</p><p>
<a name="customcharacters"><b>Custom Characters are Easier to Balance</b></a>
</p><p>
A full menagerie of default monsters is provided, which were the ones used in Tendry's Tale.
Tendry's Tale takes a different approach to things than many custom level sets have done over the years.
Some prime examples are its low number of stat gems combined with the Design-o-Matic,
and a lack of regular small uses of greckle gates. Greckle gates scale very poorly to the amount of money
dropped by the default monsters, and the player will have a glut of money very quickly.
As such, we have seen over and over again players start off strong with the first tier of monsters,
then struggle with the balance more and more as the level set progresses before eventually giving up.
</p><p>
The trick is to create your own monster stat lines. Play around in the editor with a suite of custom monsters.
Place some gems and equipment in a room, and see how the damage output changes as you collect them.
You can work this out with math, or just play around until the results feel good.
</p><p>
As you develop the level, you may end up placing a different amount of stat gems than you had anticipated.
If the player's growth ends up different to your plan, it's very easy to quickly rebalance the monsters,
making them stronger or weaker as needed to account for the new player stat growth.
This will save you a lot of headache over time. It's so nice to just make a hard-hitting swordsman hit
harder if you need to and not have to worry about changing earlier decisions to limit the player's resources.
</p><p>
Best of all, if you really need something different, you can just make a new monster with new stats
to cover this scenario. The number of custom monsters you can make is practically limitless, and
with the ability to easily recolour them using the built-in variables you can get visually distinguishable
monsters very easily without having to produce any artwork yourself.
<p></p>
<a name="percentdamage"><b>Avoid Percent Damage</b></a>
</p><p>
Hot tiles and aumtlich beams take off a percentage of your health by default. (Yes, and explosions
too, wise guy!) Percent damage is widely regarded as the biggest mistake of Tendry's Tale.
<p></p>
The issue with percent damage is that it's very easy to make it cost almost nothing by very tediously
micro-managing your health. This usually involves maximising the amount of running back-and-forth
across the entire level set to collect tiny potions left behind in the first level.
While DROD RPG is all about leaving things for later, percent damage tends to make it excessive.
Decisions where damage can be reduced to almost nothing "trivially" aren't very fun and hard to balance.
<p></p>
You can use built in variables to change the value of hot tiles, aumtlich beams, fire traps, and yes,
even explosions. These can all be set to deal flat damage or percent damage. I really strongly recommend
changing hot tiles and aumtlich beams to deal flat damage if you want to use them.
<p></p>
<a name="shortcuts"><b>Shortcuts and Fast Travel Considerations</b></a>
</p><p>
While on the topic of back-and-forth, you can make your level set more enjoyable by trying to decrease
the amount of time it takes to traverse it. Compact, looping level designs that open shortcuts back to previous
rooms are much more pleasant than long stringy layouts that require you to re-traverse the entire level.
</p><p>
The new world map feature is a great way to make travelling to any other staircase only a single click away.
</p><p>
By holding Ctrl players can fast travel to previously explored rooms or staircases. This makes moving
large distances very fast and much more pleasant to play. But the fast travel system only moves to the closest
room edge in that direction. Sometimes you want there to be multiple exits to a room in the same direction.
</p><p>
There are a number of things you can do to help here. If one exit only has limited use, try to make its path
more winding and longer so fast travel selects the other one. You can also use tunnels to make paths invisible
to fast travel. Consider orbs that toggle access to a different path so players can choose where it takes them.
</p><p>
Be wary of fast travel sending the player into the clutches of goblins and waterskippers, or onto pressure
plates. Similarly, please take care to avoid putting checkpoints along the path that fast travel will take.
It is very easy to accidentally overwrite an autosave you didn't mean to.
Test how fast travel moves between room edges.
</p><p>
<a name="puzzles"><b>Beware Puzzles with High Input Requirements</b></a>
</p><p>
DROD RPG is a very different kind of game from the rest of the classic DROD series, but there is overlap.
It can be very tempting to make puzzles in the style of the classic DROD games.
I also did this in A Courageous Rescue. But please be very careful when making puzzles for RPG level sets.
</p><p>
In classic DROD, you will only solve a puzzle once. RPG often has you repeat sections of the game multiple times.
If you want to load back to a save from before you solved the puzzle, you now have to do it again.
Would you want to solve your own puzzle 3 times? How about 10 times?
</p><p>
Some puzzles are particularly bad for requiring a large number of moves. Some examples include trapdoor puzzles,
or the platform puzzles in Tendry's Tale. The more moves it requires, the worse it is to have to solve it again.
</p><p>
If you really must make the puzzle, first ask yourself it would be be better placed in a classic DROD hold.
But if it has to go into a DROD RPG level set, then strongly consider making it skippable for free. People who
want to optimise your level set will be very grateful.
</p><p>
<a name="conclusion"><b>In Conclusion</b></a>
</p><p>
Honestly there is a lot more that could be said, but I felt that these were the most important
to help you avoid the most common pitfalls. There is still a lot to explore with the gameplay of
DROD RPG and we look forward to seeing what you build.
</p><p>
Most importantly of all, make sure to have fun with the architecture process!
