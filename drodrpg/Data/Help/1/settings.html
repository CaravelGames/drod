<h3><u>Changing Settings</u></h3>
<p>The Settings Screen can be reached from the <a href="commands.html">Main
Menu</a> by choosing the "Change <b>S</b>ettings" option. &nbsp;The following settings
are available, divided across three sub-menus:</p>
<p><a name="personal"><b>Personal</b></a> - Enter your player name and optional
 <a href="caravelNet.html">CaravelNet</a> information here.</p>
<p><a name="graphics"><b>Graphics</b></a> - Click "Use <a name="fullscreen">full screen</a>" to toggle between
full screen and windowed mode (1024x768). &nbsp;Note that you can also
use the F10 key to do this at any time. &nbsp;Turning off <a name="alpha">"Alpha blending"</a>
and <a name="environment">"Environmental Effects"</a> can
reduce slowdown for certain in-game effects if you're experiencing a low
framerate.  However, it will also disable all those nice fade effects.
"Combat Damage Preview" will display total expected damage numbers for monsters, and amounts for collectables.</p>
<p><a name="sound"><b>Sound</b></a> - You may turn sound effects, game <a name="speech">speech</a> and background <a name="music">music</a>
on or off and set the volume each is played at. Unclick "Show <a name="subtitles">subtitles</a> when voices play"
if you do not want subtitle text to be displayed in the game while characters
are talking.  If sound effects or music
doesn't work, first try closing other applications and restarting DROD.
If you are still without sound, try rebooting your computer.</p>
<p><a name="special"><b>Game speed</b></a> - Set the
<a name="combatspeed"><b>Combat Rate</b></a> slider to change how fast rounds of combat
play out.  The highest setting resolves fights instantly (recommended for players
experienced with the combat system only). <a name="repeatrate"><b>Repeat Rate</b></a>
controls the keyboard repeat rate (i.e. movement rate) during play.
&nbsp;Increasing it will decrease the delay between moves when a key is
held down.  Decreasing it will make movement animations smoother.</p>
<p><b><a href="keyboard.html" name="keyboard">Commands</a></b> - Use to
redefine the game commands to different keyboard keys. &nbsp;If you are using a
non-US keyboard or have selected a layout other than Qwerty (i.e.
Dvorak), you may see incorrect key descriptions as you redefine keys.
&nbsp;Despite this, the key redefinitions will probably work once you
begin playing the game. &nbsp;(Sorry. &nbsp;We would like to fix this
problem in a future release.)</p>
<p><a name="disablemouse"><b>Disable mouse movement</b></a> - 
This option is unchecked by default, allowing the mouse to be used to move
and rotate the player in the game.  Check this box if you want to disable
using the mouse to move the player.  While set, this will also remove the extra
command buttons on the sidebar used during mouse-controlled play.</p>
<p><a name="editor"><b>Editor</b></a> - When "Save
automatically" is checked, changes you make to a room in the <a
 href="editroom.html">editor</a> are saved on leaving the room.
&nbsp;Turn this option off if you want to be prompted before saving any
room changes. &nbsp;Check "Show item tips" to receive help placing
special objects in the room. Check "Automatically Preview Characters" to
default to showing the in-game appearance of NPCs.</p>
<p><a name="special"><b>Special</b></a> - "Confirm new game" will ask you if you wish to start a new game so
you don't accidentally overwrite your "continue" saved game. You can disable autosaves by
unchecking "Enable autosaves". "Show banner for non-best local scores" will show you how
close you are to your personal best when scoring a scorepoint you have previously scored.</p>
