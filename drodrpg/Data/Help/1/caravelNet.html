<h3><u>CaravelNet Usage</u></h3>
<p><a name="news">If</a> you have a connection to the Internet, you can keep up with the
latest CaravelNet news on the <a href="commands.html">title screen</a> as you
play by enabling the "Connect to CaravelNet" check box in your player profile
on the Change Settings screen.</p>
<p><a name="login"><u>CaravelNet Login</u></a>.  With a CaravelNet user license, you may take advantage of special
online features and receive special game information from the CaravelNet site and forum.
To login to CaravelNet, check "Connect to CaravelNet" and enter your registered
CaravelNet username into the CaravelNet Name field.  Then click "Request New Key"
and a new password key will be emailed to you.  Copy-and-paste the key
into the CaravelNet Key field to login to CaravelNet from the game.</p>

  <li><a name="scores">Compete</a> for the best scores online.  When you reach score
      points in the game, your score will be uploaded to the Caravel high score tables,
	  where others will be able to bear witness of your keen intellect.
      Your high scores display both your CaravelNet username and the name of your
      local player profile.</li>

rooms you have explored while playing offline to your CaravelNet account.
