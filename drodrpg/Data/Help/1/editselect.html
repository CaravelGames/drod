<h3><u>Level Editor</u></h3>
<p>The Level Editor is reached by choosing "<b>B</b>uild levels" from the
<a href="commands.html">Main Menu</a>.&nbsp; You can use it to edit any
hold (dungeon), level or room in the game's data file.</p>
<p>The Level Editor has the following options available:</p>
<p><a name="choosehold"><b>Choose Hold</b></a> - Click on the name of any hold in the list to edit it.
Add a new one of your own by clicking "New Hold". &nbsp;You will be asked to
provide your new hold with a name that users will see it by.&nbsp; Click "Settings"
to bring up a dialog to change the hold name, description, or to provide a
personalized message that players will see upon finishing your hold.&nbsp;
Click "Copy" to make a duplicate copy of the selected hold.&nbsp; Click "Manage"
to switch to the <a href="holdselect.html">Hold Management Screen</a>, from
which you may choose to permanently delete a hold or save a hold to a file on disk.
Exporting a hold to disk allows you to share it with other players,
and it is suggested you back up your holds to disk regularly as you work on them.</p>
<p><a name="editprivileges"><b>Who Can Edit?</b></a> - Each hold is
accessible in the editor depending on its editing
privileges.&nbsp; The "Who Can Edit?" box specifies which
players can view and edit your hold.&nbsp; "Anyone" means that any
player who has imported your hold can view and
modify it any way they want to (this is the default).&nbsp; Selecting
"You and Conquerors" means that a player will be
able to view and edit your hold once they have completed it (found a
stairway exiting the hold). "You and Masters" means only players who have
conquered the hold and found 100% of the hold's hidden rooms
may have access to it.  "Only You" means that no other player besides the author
can ever access the hold in the editor.</p>
<p><a name="modifiedcopy">When</a> you modify a room in someone else's hold, you will be asked to
confirm the changes before saving.&nbsp; If you agree, a modified copy of the
original hold will be made and you become listed as the creator of the new,
modified hold.&nbsp; The hold name and description are changed
accordingly.&nbsp; This denotes to you and other players that your
version of the hold is a modification of someone else's hold.  If you decline
making your own copy of the hold, your changes will not be saved.</p>

<p><a name="chooselevel"><b>Levels</b></a> - Select a level
in the selected hold to edit it, or add a new level by clicking "(add new level)" from the bottom of the list. You
will be asked to provide your new level with a name that
users will see when playing. Click "Rename" to change the level name
or "Describe" to change the level description (the introductory text of the main level
entrance). Click "Delete" to permanently erase the selected
level from the game.&nbsp; Hit &lt;Ctrl-X&gt; or &lt;Ctrl-C&gt;
to copy a level. &nbsp;Hit &lt;Ctrl-V&gt; to paste that level
to the currently selected position in the level list.  <a name="rearrange">You</a> can rearrange
the order of your hold's levels by clicking on a level name and dragging it
with the mouse to a new position.  The first level in the list is always
where a new game starts.</p>
<p><a name="levelsettings"><b>Level Settings</b></a> - Displays
the author of the selected level, the date the level was created, and the
<a href="elements.html#multiplier" name="itemmultiplier"><b>Item Multiplier</b></a>
for the level.  This value
determines the effect of heath, power-ups and the cost of greckle gates on the level.</p>

<p><a name="worldmaps"><b>Maps</b></a> - Click this menu tab to switch the Levels view to a list of overworld maps in the currently selected hold. Overworld maps may be selected as alternate destinations for level exits and provide quick travel to locations you specify via in-game scripting. Click "(add new world map)" to add a new map to the hold. You will be asked to provide a name for the new map. After adding a map, click "Image" to select or reselect an image for the background for the overworld map. A default background image will be displayed if no image is provided. As with levels, you can rename, reorder and delete overworld maps.</p>

<p><a name="mapdisplaytype"><b>Map display type</b></a> - Select how map locations will be labeled on the currectly selected world map. You may choose to have level names displayed, not displayed, or only displayed once the location has been visited by the player.</p>

<p><a name="chooseroom"><b>Choose Room</b></a> - Click on the
level map to select any room in the selected level.&nbsp; A miniature view of the room will be
displayed in the bottom right corner of the screen.&nbsp; Click on
a blank area of the map adjacent to an existing room to
add a new room to the level at
that location. &nbsp;Hit &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; to copy the selected room on the map.&nbsp;
Press &lt;Ctrl-X&gt; to cut a room for pasting in a different location. &nbsp;
Hit &lt;Ctrl-V&gt; to paste that room to the currently
selected spot on the map. &nbsp;Hit the &lt;delete&gt; key to
permanently erase a room.</p>
<p><a name="roomstyle"><b>Room Style</b></a> - Each room can have a given style, or motif (graphics and music),
associated with it. &nbsp;Choose one from the list to set the selected
room to that motif.  If you hold down the <b>Control</b> key while selecting a new style,
all the rooms in the level will be set to the new style.</p>
<p><a name="weather"><b>Weather</b></a> - Each room has its own environmental settings.  To configure
them, click Weather to bring up <a href="weather.html">this dialog</a>.</p>
<p><a name="secret"><b>Hidden Room</b></a> - Check this box to mark this room as a hidden room.
Hidden rooms will not be marked on the minimap when the player acquires a level map.
Hidden rooms found by a player are tallied on the <a href="restore.html">
Restore screen</a>.  Once a hold is completed, the percentage of hidden rooms
found overall will be shown on the <a href="holdselect.html">Hold Select</a>
screen.  100% of rooms marked hidden must be found in order for
the player to be able to edit a hold with "You and Masters" access.</p>
<p><a name="editroom">Click</a> the "<b>E</b>dit Room" button or click on the mini-room image to
begin <a href="editroom.html">editing the selected room</a>.</p>
<p><a name="levelstats"><b>Level/hold stats summary</b></a> - Press &lt;F4&gt; to view a pop-up dialog that shows summary information on power-up items,
doors and keys in the current level.  Press &lt;F3&gt; to view this information for the entire hold.
Any open doors are listed in parentheses.  The value shown for greckle gates is the total cost to open (close) them.</p>
<p><a name="reflect"><b>Reflecting the level</b></a> - Press &lt;F7&gt; to reflect the level
horizontally (about the vertical axis) and &lt;F8&gt; to reflect the level
vertically.  All rooms will likewise be reflected.  Hint: individual rooms
can also be reflected in the <a href="editroom.html">room editor</a> using these keys.</p>
<p><a name="rotate"><b>Rotating the level</b></a> - Press &lt;Ctrl-F7&gt; to rotate the level
clockwise.  All rooms will likewise be rotated.  Hint: individual rooms
can also be rotated in the <a href="editroom.html">room editor</a> using this key command.</p>
