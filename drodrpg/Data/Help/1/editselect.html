<h3><u>Level Editor</u></h3>
<p>The Level Editor is reached by choosing "<b>B</b>uild levels" from the
<a href="commands.html">Main Menu</a>.&nbsp; You can use it to edit any
hold (dungeon), level or room in the game's data file.</p>
<p>The Level Editor has the following options available:</p>
<p><a name="choosehold"><b>Choose Hold</b></a> - Click on the name of any hold in the list to edit it.
Add a new one of your own by clicking "New Hold". &nbsp;You will be asked to
provide your new hold with a name that users will see it by.&nbsp; Click "Settings"
to bring up a dialog to change the hold name, description, or to provide a
personalized message that players will see upon finishing your hold.&nbsp;
Click "Copy" to make a duplicate copy of the selected hold.&nbsp; Click "Manage"
to switch to the <a href="holdselect.html">Hold Management Screen</a>, from
which you may choose to permanently delete a hold or save a hold to a file on disk.
Exporting a hold to disk allows you to share it with other players,
and it is suggested you back up your holds to disk regularly as you work on them.</p>
<p><a name="editprivileges"><b>Who Can Edit?</b></a> - Each hold is
accessible in the editor depending on its editing
privileges.&nbsp; The "Who Can Edit?" box specifies which
players can view and edit your hold.&nbsp; "Anyone" means that any
player who has imported your hold can view and
modify it any way they want to (this is the default).&nbsp; Selecting
"You and Conquerors" means that a player will be
able to view and edit your hold once they have completed it (found a
stairway exiting the hold). "You and Masters" means only players who have
conquered the hold and found 100% of the hold's hidden rooms
may have access to it.  "Only You" means that no other player besides the author
can ever access the hold in the editor.</p>
<p><a name="modifiedcopy">When</a> you modify a room in someone else's hold, you will be asked to
confirm the changes before saving.&nbsp; If you agree, a modified copy of the
original hold will be made and you become listed as the creator of the new,
modified hold.&nbsp; The hold name and description are changed
accordingly.&nbsp; This denotes to you and other players that your
version of the hold is a modification of someone else's hold.  If you decline
making your own copy of the hold, your changes will not be saved.</p>
<p><a name="chooselevel"><b>Choose Level</b></a> - Choose any of the levels
in the selected hold to edit them.&nbsp; Choose one from the level list to
select it, or add one of your own by clicking "New Level". &nbsp;You
will be asked to provide your new level with a name that
users will see when playing.&nbsp; Click "Rename" to change the level name
or "Describe" to change the description (the introductory text of the main level
entrance) at any time.&nbsp; Click "Delete" to permanently erase the selected
level from the game.&nbsp; Hit &lt;Ctrl-X&gt; or &lt;Ctrl-C&gt;
to copy a level. &nbsp;Hit &lt;Ctrl-V&gt; to paste that level
to the currently selected position in the level list.  <a name="rearrange">You</a> can rearrange
the order of your hold's levels by clicking on a level name and dragging it
with the mouse to a new position.  The first level in the list is always
where a new game starts.</p>
<p><a name="levelsettings"><b>Level Settings</b></a> - Displays
the author of the selected level, the date the level was created, and the
<a href="elements.html#multiplier" name="itemmultiplier"><b>Item Multiplier</b></a>
for the level.  This value
determines the effect of heath, power-ups and the cost of greckle gates on the level.</p>
<p><a name="chooseroom"><b>Choose Room</b></a> - Click on the
level map to select any room in the selected level.&nbsp; A miniature view of the room will be
displayed in the bottom right corner of the screen.&nbsp; Click on
a blank area of the map adjacent to an existing room to
add a new room to the level at
that location. &nbsp;Hit &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; to copy the selected room on the map.&nbsp;
Press &lt;Ctrl-X&gt; to cut a room for pasting in a different location. &nbsp;
Hit &lt;Ctrl-V&gt; to paste that room to the currently
selected spot on the map. &nbsp;Hit the &lt;delete&gt; key to
permanently erase a room.</p>
<p><a name="roomstyle"><b>Room Style</b></a> - Each room can have a given style, or motif (graphics and music),
associated with it. &nbsp;Choose one from the list to set the selected
room to that motif.  If you hold down the <b>Control</b> key while selecting a new style,
all the rooms in the level will be set to the new style.</p>
<p><a name="weather"><b>Weather</b></a> - Each room has its own environmental settings.  To configure
them, click Weather to bring up <a href="weather.html">this dialog</a>.</p>
<p><a name="secret"><b>Hidden Room</b></a> - Check this box to mark this room as a hidden room.
Hidden rooms will not be marked on the minimap when the player acquires a level map.
Hidden rooms found by a player are tallied on the <a href="restore.html">
Restore screen</a>.  Once a hold is completed, the percentage of hidden rooms
found overall will be shown on the <a href="holdselect.html">Hold Select</a>
screen.  100% of rooms marked hidden must be found in order for
the player to be able to edit a hold with "You and Masters" access.</p>
<p><a name="editroom">Click</a> the "<b>E</b>dit Room" button or click on the mini-room image to
begin <a href="editroom.html">editing the selected room</a>.</p>
<p><a name="levelstats"><b>Level/hold stats summary</b></a> - Press &lt;F4&gt; to view a pop-up dialog that shows summary information on power-up items,
doors and keys in the current level.  Press &lt;F3&gt; to view this information for the entire hold.
Any open doors are listed in parentheses.  The value shown for greckle gates is the total cost to open (close) them.</p>
<p><a name="reflect"><b>Reflecting the level</b></a> - Press &lt;F7&gt; to reflect the level
horizontally (about the vertical axis) and &lt;F8&gt; to reflect the level
vertically.  All rooms will likewise be reflected.  Hint: individual rooms
can also be reflected in the <a href="editroom.html">room editor</a> using these keys.</p>
<p><a name="rotate"><b>Rotating the level</b></a> - Press &lt;Ctrl-F7&gt; to rotate the level
clockwise.  All rooms will likewise be rotated.  Hint: individual rooms
can also be rotated in the <a href="editroom.html">room editor</a> using this key command.</p>
