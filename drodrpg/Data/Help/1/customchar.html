<h3><u><b>Custom Character Management</b></u></h3>

<p>Here, you may create custom NPCs for use anywhere in the current hold.</p>
<p><b>Add Character</b> - Type a name and click "Add Character"
to create a new custom character for the hold.</p>
<p><b>Characters</b> - Displays the set of custom NPCs you have defined for the hold.
Click one to select it for modification.  Double-click one to rename it.</p>
<p><b>Graphic</b> - Choose what the selected custom character will look like by default.</p>
<p><a name="defaultscript"><b>Edit default script</b></a> - Click to define
a default script to be used by all instances of this custom NPC in the hold.
That is, when you place an NPC of this type, if you leave its script empty,
then the default script will be used automatically.  <i>Hint</i>: Use default
scripts to define new monster types and game elements, where each instance
should share a common behavior.</p>
<p><a name="avatar"><b>Custom avatar</b></a> - Import a custom face from an
image file on disk into your hold. When an NPC of this custom type speaks,
this image will be shown in the game screen's face box (130x164 pixels).
The custom face may be extended to the right to provide protraits for speaking moods, with each additional portrait being 130 pixels wide.
The supported moods, in the order they should appear in the image are <b>Normal</b>, <b>Aggressive</b>, <b>Nervous</b>, <b>Striking</b>, <b>Happy</b>, <b>Dying</b>, and <b>Talking</b>.</p>
<p><a name="tiles"><b>Custom tiles</b></a> - Click to import a custom tileset
for this character.
The tileset may be a grid of from one to nine columns of 44x44 pixel tiles.
Each column stores tiles for a specific orientation, starting from northward and
progressing clockwise at 45 degree increments.
The ninth column stores the central <a name="orientation">orientation</a> (i.e. no direction).  If an
orientation to display is not included, the northward image is used by default.
An optional <b>second row</b> may be included to display a second animation frame, toggled
at random time intervals with the first frame.
For character types wielding swords, optional third and fourth rows may be included.
The <b>third row</b> contains custom sword images for the NPC.
The <b>fourth row</b> stores custom images for the NPC when it is not wielding its sword.
When the third and fourth rows are not included, then tiles from the first
row are displayed in their place.  When the set graphic type belongs to an
entity without a sword, the third and fourth rows are ignored.</p>
<p><a name="animationspeed"><b>Animation speed</b></a> - Custom tiles may also
be used to display a fully animated image.  When custom tiles have been imported,
set this field to a non-zero value to specify how much time (in milli-seconds)
should pass before advancing to the next display frame.  Your image may contain
as many rows of animation as you like, up to about 750 frames.</p>
<p><b>Default</b> - Click to <a name="reset">reset</a> the custom NPC's avatar or
tileset to the default (i.e. the selected graphic type).</p>
<p><a name="delete"><b>Delete</b></a> - Click to permanently remove the selected custom
NPC from your hold.  This will cause any NPCs previously set to this type
to now use a default appearance.</p>
