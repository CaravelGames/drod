<h3><u>Character Scripting</u></h3>
<p><a name="npc">Non-player characters (NPCs)</a> and scripts
can be used to present a story and special events
in your hold by defining a list of things to do and say.
When an NPC is placed in a room, a dialog box will appear for
customizing the NPC's appearance and behavior.  On this dialog, a list box
displays the character's script, which is initially empty.
The script tells the NPC what to do when the player enters the room.</p>

<p><a href="script.html">Script Commands</a>. Read what script commands do and how to
use them.</p>

<p><a name="graphic"><b>Graphic</b></a> - Select what your NPC will look like from the list of
available entities.  Selecting "None" (the default)
indicates this NPC is used for scripting events but cannot appear as a visible character
in the room.  Hint: With the "None" setting, a character cannot be made visible.
</p>
<p><a name="management"><b>Character Management</b></a> -
Click "Characters" to bring up the <a href="customchar.html">Custom Character Management</a> dialog.</p>
<p><a name="visible"><b>Visible</b></a> - If checked, the NPC will be visible when the player
enters the room.  Otherwise, it will be invisible.  When an NPC is invisible, its
script continues to play but it otherwise behaves as if it were not in the room.
Hint: making a character with a "None" graphic visible will set it to the
"Citizen 1" type.</p>
<p><a name="charoptions"><b>Options</b></a> - Click to set the NPC's options:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Ghost display</b>, which makes a character appear on screen even when not set to be visible.
  Ghost display characters have no "physical" presence in the room, e.g. they can be walked through.</li>
  <li><b>Minimap treasure</b>, which makes a character count as a treasure for the purpose of automatically
  coloring the room on the minimap. This only applies if the character is visible or has ghost display.</li>
  <li><b>_MyHue</b>, which allows the predefined <a href="script.html#myhue">_MyHue</a> var to be set for the character. Setting it this way allows it to be used when displaying an NPC's in-game appearance in the editor.</li>
  <li><b>_MySaturation</b>, which allows the predefined <a href="script.html#mysaturation">_MySaturation</a> var to be set for the character. Setting it this way allows it to be used when displaying an NPC's in-game appearance in the editor.</li>
  <li><b>_MyColor</b>, which allows the predefined <a href="script.html#mycolor">_MyColor</a> var to be set for the character. Setting it this way allows it to be used when displaying an NPC's in-game appearance in the editor.</li>
  <li><b>Speech Color</b>, which controls the color of the character's speech subtitles. Each input takes a value of 0 to 255, and the three values are combined into a single RGB color value. If all inputs are zero, the default subtitle color will be used.</li>
  <li><b>Processing sequence</b>, which controls the order of scripts running in a room. Scripts with lower processing sequence values run earlier, and scripts with higher values run later. This does not affect the order in which equipment scripts will be run.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="addcommand"><b>Add Command</b></a> - Click to add another <a href="script.html">command</a>
to the script.</p>
<p><a name="deletecommand"><b>Delete Command</b></a> - Deletes the selected commands from the script.  Also
performed by pressing the &lt;Delete&gt; key.</p>
<p><a name="reorder"><b>Reordering commands</b></a> - During play, commands are performed in the order
they are placed in the script.  Hold down the mouse button on a command and drag it
to reposition it in the script.</p>
<p><a name="cutcopypaste"><b>Cut-copy-paste commands</b></a> - With one or more commands selected, press
&lt;Ctrl-X&gt; to cut the commands from the script and place them in the script
clipboard.  Press &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; to make a copy of the selected script commands
and place them in the script clipboard.  Press &lt;Ctrl-V&gt; to paste the
script commands in the script clipboard after the selected script command.
The script clipboard is only valid while editing the current NPC.</p>
<p><a name="importexport"><b>Importing and exporting commands</b></a> -
Script commands may be imported from and exported to the operating system clipboard.
Press &lt;Ctrl-B&gt; to export the currently highlighted script commands.
Then you may paste these commands as text into a text editor.
Press &lt;Ctrl-Shift-B&gt; to import a text selection from the OS clipboard.
Command syntax must match that of exported commands in order for text to be
imported correctly.</p>

<p>Click "Okay" to finish customizing the NPC.</p>
<p><a name="revise">You</a> may click on the NPC in the room at any time
to revise its appearance and script.  Shift-click on an NPC to change its orientation.
<a name="reposition">Click</a> and drag an NPC to reposition it in the room.</p>
<p>Hold Alt to toggle viewing characters with the character icon, or as it will appear when playing.
You can change the game setting <a href="settings.html#editor">Automatically Preview Characters</a> to
invert this toggle.</p>
