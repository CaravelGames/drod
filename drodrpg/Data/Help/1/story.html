<h3><u>The Story</u></h3>
<p>
<b>Tendry</b> is a member of the <b>Stalwart Army</b> from the grand city of <b>Tueno</b>.
In <b>DROD RPG: Tendry's Tale</b>, the <b>Empire</b> that resides underground came to the
surface and kidnapped his countrymen!
</p><p>
Tendry founded the <b>Stalwart Delving Corps</b> to establish a team to travel beneath
and rescue the captive Tuenan citizens. Unfortunately, the Empire is large, and their network
of tunnels very complex, so progress was slow.
</p><p>
Tendry is not alone in the beneath. His previous encounters with <b>Beethro Budkin</b>,
a Smitemaster from Dugandy, proves how far-reaching the Empire's tunnel network goes. And of course,
who can forget his most faithful compainion, <b>Roachie</b>, Tendry's pet roach.
</p><p>
Join Tendry as he uncovers the mysteries of the Beneath!
