<h3><u>General Advice on Winning the Game</u></h3>

<p>Things can get pretty hard in DROD RPG, especially when you are just beginning as a new player of 
this unique game.  After a frustrating start, you might be tempted to call it quits, but we 
really don't want you to give up.  Tendry wouldn't give up!  He's very determined about 
<b>championing virtues</b> like courage, valor, and butt-kicking for goodness.
You can't let him down--he needs you to complete his quest to save his homeland
from the <b>Underground Empire</b>!</p>

<p>Save the game often! DROD RPG requires you to make a lot of decisions about resource management,
and you will frequently find yourself changing your mind about previous decisions. The more often
you save the game, the less you will need to replay.</p>

<p>Some decisions are more impactful than others. Figuring out which decisions these are will
help you make more progress sooner. There is lots of leeway to make mistakes around the less impactful
choices.</p>

<p>Your greatest weapon is knowledge. Knowing what lies ahead gives you more information.
Consider performing a "scouting run" where you make decisions very quickly to push ahead as far as you can.
When you explore a new room for the first time, your minimap will make a permanent record of that room,
so you can load your game and still look ahead. When viewing a room remotely from the minimap, you can
still use the battle key to view a detailed breakdown of the stats of the monsters in the room.</p>

<p><a name="dying">Are</a> you making mistakes or dying a lot?
Understanding battles makes it much easier to predict and plan.
Don't go rushing into fights with tough enemies.  You will get a chance to
show enemies your courage, but they might have to wait a bit.
Try to slow down a little and plan which monsters to fight.
Pay attention to how power-ups affect battles.
Remember that you can press the "<b>Backspace</b>" key to undo commands in the current room
if you make a mistake or don't like how a fight went.
If you get killed, you can even undo your death by pressing the "Backspace"
key before the hero's death scream comes to an end.</p>
