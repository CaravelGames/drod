----------------------------

### Building the application

This is the source used with DROD: The Second Sky and also with DROD RPG.
It may be used under the terms of the MPL and other licenses, described in the Licenses subdirectory.

##### Building for Windows

Currently there are three documents that describe the build process for DROD and DROD RPG:
1. *CompilingDrod_Win.md* - which describes use of an automated script for building required third-party libraries and is aimed at using VS2013 and newer, e.g., VS2019.
2. *CompilingDrod_Win_MSVS2013.md* - an earlier version of the document which points to earlier lib versions.
3. *CompilingDrod_Win_Old.md* - which was assembled for DROD TCB that should work for older versions of Visual Studio

Windows, Linux and Mac OS X compilations are supported.
Workspace files are included for Visual Studio 2005, Visual Studio 2008, Visual Studio 2013, and Visual Studio 2019 in the Master subdirectory.
Workspace files for Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 and Visual Studio 2002 are also present but likely outdated.

##### Linux builds

Ninja generator and build files for Linux are included in Master/Linux. cd to Master/Linux and run './ninjamaker' then './build' or './build -clean' for clean rebuild.

When debugging build issues edit the build file from 'ninja -k 0' to 'ninja -k N' so ninja stops building after N jobs fail.

>Options are passed to scons as 'option=value' (without the quotes), separated by spaces.
>For example, if you wanted to build DROD with FMOD audio for amd64/x86-64 (which wouldn't work since >FMOD 3.x doesn't exist for amd64, but hey, let's ignore such trifling details), you would do:
>
>`scons audio=fmod arch=amd64`
>
>The dist option should be left at the default (none).


##### Mac builds

Makefiles for Mac are included in Master/Darwin.

To build a 64-bit binary, run "make custom" (etc.)

### Contributing

1. Visit [the bugs board](http://forum.caravelgames.com/viewboard.php?BoardID=7) on the forum and select a bug you'd like to fix. 
2. If the way to fix the bug is clear or clearly defined in the thread, make a reply that you'll fix it. 
3. If the way to fix is not clear please first discuss with one of the devs how to approach it.
4. After you fix the bug make a pull request to the main repository and it will be reviewed.
5. If the PR passes the code review we'll ask you to provide a diff file, we'll patch the private repos with the changes and publish a new version of the public codebase here in this repository.

**Please note** that if you're making any changes that modify or fix the logic of the game we'll need you to provide tests in the Test project to ensure things are working as intended.

### To use SDL_mixer instead of FMOD:

Add `-lSDL_mixer` to the link flags (staticlibs in `Master/Linux/ninjamaker`) and either (1) add `-DUSE_SDL_MIXER` flag to the C++ flags (i.e., config in ninjamaker) -- this will require a clean recompile, since the dependency system doesn't detect command-line changes yet; or (2) add `#define USE_SDL_MIXER` to the top of `FrontEndLib/Sound.h` -- this will make the dependency system pick up the change, so a normal recompile is sufficient.

### Including content media

A barebones Data/drod5_0.dat file is provided, but you will need to use the drod5_0.dat file provided in an official Caravel installation of DROD (either demo or full) to make this compiled source run.  Note that files obtained from a Caravel installation are protected under the DROD copyright and are not for distribution, public or private.

Graphics/styles:
Stub and mod versions of the tile and styles graphics are available, and can be found on the Development Board on http://forum.caravelgames.com Add these graphics files to the Data/Bitmaps directory for in-game use. To avoid running in fullscreen mode, run the application with the "nofullscreen" command line parameter.

Music:
 - The music engine supports sampled sound formats (e.g. Ogg Vorbis, wave, mp3).
 - Add music files to Data/Music for in-game use.
 - Modify the [Music] section of Data/drod.ini to apply your selection of music files.
 - To avoid running with any sound or music,
 - run the application with the "nosound" command line parameter.
